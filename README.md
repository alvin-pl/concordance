Concordance Project

Overview:
This Java project generates a concordance from a text file, "the_jungle_book.txt". It reads the file, creates an index of all words with their occurrences, sorts them alphabetically, and then allows users to query the text for specific words and their context within the book.

Features:
Read and Process Text: Parses the text file into words.
Create Concordance File: Outputs a file with each word and its indices in the text.
Sorting: Implements merge sort to alphabetically order the words.
Remove Duplicates: Filters out duplicate entries.
Binary Search: Efficiently finds the position of a word in the sorted list.
Context Query: Allows users to enter a word and returns the word in the context of its usage in the text.
