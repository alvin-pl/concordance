_Night-Song 419
in 420
the 421
Jungle_ 422
 423
It 424
was 425
seven 426
o’clock 427
of 428
a 429
very 430
warm 431
evening 432
in 433
the 434
Seeonee 435
hills 436
when 437
Father 438
Wolf 439
woke 440
up 441
from 442
his 443
day’s 444
rest, 445
scratched 446
himself, 447
yawned, 448
and 449
spread 450
out 451
his 452
paws 453
one 454
after 455
the 456
other 457
to 458
get 459
rid 460
of 461
the 462
sleepy 463
feeling 464
in 465
their 466
tips. 467
Mother 468
Wolf 469
lay 470
with 471
her 472
big 473
gray 474
nose 475
dropped 476
across 477
her 478
four 479
tumbling, 480
squealing 481
cubs, 482
and 483
the 484
moon 485
shone 486
into 487
the 488
mouth 489
of 490
the 491
cave 492
where 493
they 494
all 495
lived. 496
“Augrh!” 497
said 498
Father 499
Wolf. 500
“It 501
is 502
time 503
to 504
hunt 505
again.” 506
He 507
was 508
going 509
to 510
spring 511
down 512
hill 513
when 514
a 515
little 516
shadow 517
with 518
a 519
bushy 520
tail 521
crossed 522
the 523
threshold 524
and 525
whined: 526
“Good 527
luck 528
go 529
with 530
you, 531
O 532
Chief 533
of 534
the 535
Wolves. 536
And 537
good 538
luck 539
and 540
strong 541
white 542
teeth 543
go 544
with 545
noble 546
children 547
that 548
they 549
may 550
never 551
forget 552
the 553
hungry 554
in 555
this 556
world.” 557
 558
It 559
was 560
the 561
jackal--Tabaqui, 562
the 563
Dish-licker--and 564
the 565
wolves 566
of 567
India 568
despise 569
Tabaqui 570
because 571
he 572
runs 573
about 574
making 575
mischief, 576
and 577
telling 578
tales, 579
and 580
eating 581
rags 582
and 583
pieces 584
of 585
leather 586
from 587
the 588
village 589
rubbish-heaps. 590
But 591
they 592
are 593
afraid 594
of 595
him 596
too, 597
because 598
Tabaqui, 599
more 600
than 601
anyone 602
else 603
in 604
the 605
jungle, 606
is 607
apt 608
to 609
go 610
mad, 611
and 612
then 613
he 614
forgets 615
that 616
he 617
was 618
ever 619
afraid 620
of 621
anyone, 622
and 623
runs 624
through 625
the 626
forest 627
biting 628
everything 629
in 630
his 631
way. 632
Even 633
the 634
tiger 635
runs 636
and 637
hides 638
when 639
little 640
Tabaqui 641
goes 642
mad, 643
for 644
madness 645
is 646
the 647
most 648
disgraceful 649
thing 650
that 651
can 652
overtake 653
a 654
wild 655
creature. 656
We 657
call 658
it 659
hydrophobia, 660
but 661
they 662
call 663
it 664
dewanee--the 665
madness--and 666
run. 667
 668
“Enter, 669
then, 670
and 671
look,” 672
said 673
Father 674
Wolf 675
stiffly, 676
“but 677
there 678
is 679
no 680
food 681
here.” 682
 683
“For 684
a 685
wolf, 686
no,” 687
said 688
Tabaqui, 689
“but 690
for 691
so 692
mean 693
a 694
person 695
as 696
myself 697
a 698
dry 699
bone 700
is 701
a 702
good 703
feast. 704
Who 705
are 706
we, 707
the 708
Gidur-log 709
[the 710
jackal 711
people], 712
to 713
pick 714
and 715
choose?” 716
He 717
scuttled 718
to 719
the 720
back 721
of 722
the 723
cave, 724
where 725
he 726
found 727
the 728
bone 729
of 730
a 731
buck 732
with 733
some 734
meat 735
on 736
it, 737
and 738
sat 739
cracking 740
the 741
end 742
merrily. 743
 744
“All 745
thanks 746
for 747
this 748
good 749
meal,” 750
he 751
said, 752
licking 753
his 754
lips. 755
“How 756
beautiful 757
are 758
the 759
noble 760
children! 761
How 762
large 763
are 764
their 765
eyes! 766
And 767
so 768
young 769
too! 770
Indeed, 771
indeed, 772
I 773
might 774
have 775
remembered 776
that 777
the 778
children 779
of 780
kings 781
are 782
men 783
from 784
the 785
beginning.” 786
 787
Now, 788
Tabaqui 789
knew 790
as 791
well 792
as 793
anyone 794
else 795
that 796
there 797
is 798
nothing 799
so 800
unlucky 801
as 802
to 803
compliment 804
children 805
to 806
their 807
faces. 808
It 809
pleased 810
him 811
to 812
see 813
Mother 814
and 815
Father 816
Wolf 817
look 818
uncomfortable. 819
 820
Tabaqui 821
sat 822
still, 823
rejoicing 824
in 825
the 826
mischief 827
that 828
he 829
had 830
made, 831
and 832
then 833
he 834
said 835
spitefully: 836
 837
“Shere 838
Khan, 839
the 840
Big 841
One, 842
has 843
shifted 844
his 845
hunting 846
grounds. 847
He 848
will 849
hunt 850
among 851
these 852
hills 853
for 854
the 855
next 856
moon, 857
so 858
he 859
has 860
told 861
me.” 862
 863
Shere 864
Khan 865
was 866
the 867
tiger 868
who 869
lived 870
near 871
the 872
Waingunga 873
River, 874
twenty 875
miles 876
away. 877
 878
“He 879
has 880
no 881
right!” 882
Father 883
Wolf 884
began 885
angrily--“By 886
the 887
Law 888
of 889
the 890
Jungle 891
he 892
has 893
no 894
right 895
to 896
change 897
his 898
quarters 899
without 900
due 901
warning. 902
He 903
will 904
frighten 905
every 906
head 907
of 908
game 909
within 910
ten 911
miles, 912
and 913
I--I 914
have 915
to 916
kill 917
for 918
two, 919
these 920
days.” 921
 922
“His 923
mother 924
did 925
not 926
call 927
him 928
Lungri 929
[the 930
Lame 931
One] 932
for 933
nothing,” 934
said 935
Mother 936
Wolf 937
quietly. 938
“He 939
has 940
been 941
lame 942
in 943
one 944
foot 945
from 946
his 947
birth. 948
That 949
is 950
why 951
he 952
has 953
only 954
killed 955
cattle. 956
Now 957
the 958
villagers 959
of 960
the 961
Waingunga 962
are 963
angry 964
with 965
him, 966
and 967
he 968
has 969
come 970
here 971
to 972
make 973
our 974
villagers 975
angry. 976
They 977
will 978
scour 979
the 980
jungle 981
for 982
him 983
when 984
he 985
is 986
far 987
away, 988
and 989
we 990
and 991
our 992
children 993
must 994
run 995
when 996
the 997
grass 998
is 999
set 1000
alight. 1001
Indeed, 1002
we 1003
are 1004
very 1005
grateful 1006
to 1007
Shere 1008
Khan!” 1009
 1010
“Shall 1011
I 1012
tell 1013
him 1014
of 1015
your 1016
gratitude?” 1017
said 1018
Tabaqui. 1019
 1020
“Out!” 1021
snapped 1022
Father 1023
Wolf. 1024
“Out 1025
and 1026
hunt 1027
with 1028
thy 1029
master. 1030
Thou 1031
hast 1032
done 1033
harm 1034
enough 1035
for 1036
one 1037
night.” 1038
 1039
“I 1040
go,” 1041
said 1042
Tabaqui 1043
quietly. 1044
“Ye 1045
can 1046
hear 1047
Shere 1048
Khan 1049
below 1050
in 1051
the 1052
thickets. 1053
I 1054
might 1055
have 1056
saved 1057
myself 1058
the 1059
message.” 1060
 1061
Father 1062
Wolf 1063
listened, 1064
and 1065
below 1066
in 1067
the 1068
valley 1069
that 1070
ran 1071
down 1072
to 1073
a 1074
little 1075
river 1076
he 1077
heard 1078
the 1079
dry, 1080
angry, 1081
snarly, 1082
singsong 1083
whine 1084
of 1085
a 1086
tiger 1087
who 1088
has 1089
caught 1090
nothing 1091
and 1092
does 1093
not 1094
care 1095
if 1096
all 1097
the 1098
jungle 1099
knows 1100
it. 1101
 1102
“The 1103
fool!” 1104
said 1105
Father 1106
Wolf. 1107
“To 1108
begin 1109
a 1110
night’s 1111
work 1112
with 1113
that 1114
noise! 1115
Does 1116
he 1117
think 1118
that 1119
our 1120
buck 1121
are 1122
like 1123
his 1124
fat 1125
Waingunga 1126
bullocks?” 1127
 1128
“H’sh. 1129
It 1130
is 1131
neither 1132
bullock 1133
nor 1134
buck 1135
he 1136
hunts 1137
to-night,” 1138
said 1139
Mother 1140
Wolf. 1141
“It 1142
is 1143
Man.” 1144
 1145
The 1146
whine 1147
had 1148
changed 1149
to 1150
a 1151
sort 1152
of 1153
humming 1154
purr 1155
that 1156
seemed 1157
to 1158
come 1159
from 1160
every 1161
quarter 1162
of 1163
the 1164
compass. 1165
It 1166
was 1167
the 1168
noise 1169
that 1170
bewilders 1171
woodcutters 1172
and 1173
gypsies 1174
sleeping 1175
in 1176
the 1177
open, 1178
and 1179
makes 1180
them 1181
run 1182
sometimes 1183
into 1184
the 1185
very 1186
mouth 1187
of 1188
the 1189
tiger. 1190
 1191
“Man!” 1192
said 1193
Father 1194
Wolf, 1195
showing 1196
all 1197
his 1198
white 1199
teeth. 1200
“Faugh! 1201
Are 1202
there 1203
not 1204
enough 1205
beetles 1206
and 1207
frogs 1208
in 1209
the 1210
tanks 1211
that 1212
he 1213
must 1214
eat 1215
Man, 1216
and 1217
on 1218
our 1219
ground 1220
too!” 1221
 1222
The 1223
Law 1224
of 1225
the 1226
Jungle, 1227
which 1228
never 1229
orders 1230
anything 1231
without 1232
a 1233
reason, 1234
forbids 1235
every 1236
beast 1237
to 1238
eat 1239
Man 1240
except 1241
when 1242
he 1243
is 1244
killing 1245
to 1246
show 1247
his 1248
children 1249
how 1250
to 1251
kill, 1252
and 1253
then 1254
he 1255
must 1256
hunt 1257
outside 1258
the 1259
hunting 1260
grounds 1261
of 1262
his 1263
pack 1264
or 1265
tribe. 1266
The 1267
real 1268
reason 1269
for 1270
this 1271
is 1272
that 1273
man-killing 1274
means, 1275
sooner 1276
or 1277
later, 1278
the 1279
arrival 1280
of 1281
white 1282
men 1283
on 1284
elephants, 1285
with 1286
guns, 1287
and 1288
hundreds 1289
of 1290
brown 1291
men 1292
with 1293
gongs 1294
and 1295
rockets 1296
and 1297
torches. 1298
Then 1299
everybody 1300
in 1301
the 1302
jungle 1303
suffers. 1304
The 1305
reason 1306
the 1307
beasts 1308
give 1309
among 1310
themselves 1311
is 1312
that 1313
Man 1314
is 1315
the 1316
weakest 1317
and 1318
most 1319
defenseless 1320
of 1321
all 1322
living 1323
things, 1324
and 1325
it 1326
is 1327
unsportsmanlike 1328
to 1329
touch 1330
him. 1331
They 1332
say 1333
too--and 1334
it 1335
is 1336
true--that 1337
man-eaters 1338
become 1339
mangy, 1340
and 1341
lose 1342
their 1343
teeth. 1344
 1345
The 1346
purr 1347
grew 1348
louder, 1349
and 1350
ended 1351
in 1352
the 1353
full-throated 1354
“Aaarh!” 1355
of 1356
the 1357
tiger’s 1358
charge. 1359
 1360
Then 1361
there 1362
was 1363
a 1364
howl--an 1365
untigerish 1366
howl--from 1367
Shere 1368
Khan. 1369
“He 1370
has 1371
missed,” 1372
said 1373
Mother 1374
Wolf. 1375
“What 1376
is 1377
it?” 1378
 1379
Father 1380
Wolf 1381
ran 1382
out 1383
a 1384
few 1385
paces 1386
and 1387
heard 1388
Shere 1389
Khan 1390
muttering 1391
and 1392
mumbling 1393
savagely 1394
as 1395
he 1396
tumbled 1397
about 1398
in 1399
the 1400
scrub. 1401
 1402
“The 1403
fool 1404
has 1405
had 1406
no 1407
more 1408
sense 1409
than 1410
to 1411
jump 1412
at 1413
a 1414
woodcutter’s 1415
campfire, 1416
and 1417
has 1418
burned 1419
his 1420
feet,” 1421
said 1422
Father 1423
Wolf 1424
with 1425
a 1426
grunt. 1427
“Tabaqui 1428
is 1429
with 1430
him.” 1431
 1432
“Something 1433
is 1434
coming 1435
uphill,” 1436
said 1437
Mother 1438
Wolf, 1439
twitching 1440
one 1441
ear. 1442
“Get 1443
ready.” 1444
 1445
The 1446
bushes 1447
rustled 1448
a 1449
little 1450
in 1451
the 1452
thicket, 1453
and 1454
Father 1455
Wolf 1456
dropped 1457
with 1458
his 1459
haunches 1460
under 1461
him, 1462
ready 1463
for 1464
his 1465
leap. 1466
Then, 1467
if 1468
you 1469
had 1470
been 1471
watching, 1472
you 1473
would 1474
have 1475
seen 1476
the 1477
most 1478
wonderful 1479
thing 1480
in 1481
the 1482
world--the 1483
wolf 1484
checked 1485
in 1486
mid-spring. 1487
He 1488
made 1489
his 1490
bound 1491
before 1492
he 1493
saw 1494
what 1495
it 1496
was 1497
he 1498
was 1499
jumping 1500
at, 1501
and 1502
then 1503
he 1504
tried 1505
to 1506
stop 1507
himself. 1508
The 1509
result 1510
was 1511
that 1512
he 1513
shot 1514
up 1515
straight 1516
into 1517
the 1518
air 1519
for 1520
four 1521
or 1522
five 1523
feet, 1524
landing 1525
almost 1526
where 1527
he 1528
left 1529
ground. 1530
 1531
“Man!” 1532
he 1533
snapped. 1534
“A 1535
man’s 1536
cub. 1537
Look!” 1538
 1539
Directly 1540
in 1541
front 1542
of 1543
him, 1544
holding 1545
on 1546
by 1547
a 1548
low 1549
branch, 1550
stood 1551
a 1552
naked 1553
brown 1554
baby 1555
who 1556
could 1557
just 1558
walk--as 1559
soft 1560
and 1561
as 1562
dimpled 1563
a 1564
little 1565
atom 1566
as 1567
ever 1568
came 1569
to 1570
a 1571
wolf’s 1572
cave 1573
at 1574
night. 1575
He 1576
looked 1577
up 1578
into 1579
Father 1580
Wolf’s 1581
face, 1582
and 1583
laughed. 1584
 1585
“Is 1586
that 1587
a 1588
man’s 1589
cub?” 1590
said 1591
Mother 1592
Wolf. 1593
“I 1594
have 1595
never 1596
seen 1597
one. 1598
Bring 1599
it 1600
here.” 1601
 1602
A 1603
Wolf 1604
accustomed 1605
to 1606
moving 1607
his 1608
own 1609
cubs 1610
can, 1611
if 1612
necessary, 1613
mouth 1614
an 1615
egg 1616
without 1617
breaking 1618
it, 1619
and 1620
though 1621
Father 1622
Wolf’s 1623
jaws 1624
closed 1625
right 1626
on 1627
the 1628
child’s 1629
back 1630
not 1631
a 1632
tooth 1633
even 1634
scratched 1635
the 1636
skin 1637
as 1638
he 1639
laid 1640
it 1641
down 1642
among 1643
the 1644
cubs. 1645
 1646
“How 1647
little! 1648
How 1649
naked, 1650
and--how 1651
bold!” 1652
said 1653
Mother 1654
Wolf 1655
softly. 1656
The 1657
baby 1658
was 1659
pushing 1660
his 1661
way 1662
between 1663
the 1664
cubs 1665
to 1666
get 1667
close 1668
to 1669
the 1670
warm 1671
hide. 1672
“Ahai! 1673
He 1674
is 1675
taking 1676
his 1677
meal 1678
with 1679
the 1680
others. 1681
And 1682
so 1683
this 1684
is 1685
a 1686
man’s 1687
cub. 1688
Now, 1689
was 1690
there 1691
ever 1692
a 1693
wolf 1694
that 1695
could 1696
boast 1697
of 1698
a 1699
man’s 1700
cub 1701
among 1702
her 1703
children?” 1704
 1705
“I 1706
have 1707
heard 1708
now 1709
and 1710
again 1711
of 1712
such 1713
a 1714
thing, 1715
but 1716
never 1717
in 1718
our 1719
Pack 1720
or 1721
in 1722
my 1723
time,” 1724
said 1725
Father 1726
Wolf. 1727
“He 1728
is 1729
altogether 1730
without 1731
hair, 1732
and 1733
I 1734
could 1735
kill 1736
him 1737
with 1738
a 1739
touch 1740
of 1741
my 1742
foot. 1743
But 1744
see, 1745
he 1746
looks 1747
up 1748
and 1749
is 1750
not 1751
afraid.” 1752
 1753
The 1754
moonlight 1755
was 1756
blocked 1757
out 1758
of 1759
the 1760
mouth 1761
of 1762
the 1763
cave, 1764
for 1765
Shere 1766
Khan’s 1767
great 1768
square 1769
head 1770
and 1771
shoulders 1772
were 1773
thrust 1774
into 1775
the 1776
entrance. 1777
Tabaqui, 1778
behind 1779
him, 1780
was 1781
squeaking: 1782
“My 1783
lord, 1784
my 1785
lord, 1786
it 1787
went 1788
in 1789
here!” 1790
 1791
“Shere 1792
Khan 1793
does 1794
us 1795
great 1796
honor,” 1797
said 1798
Father 1799
Wolf, 1800
but 1801
his 1802
eyes 1803
were 1804
very 1805
angry. 1806
“What 1807
does 1808
Shere 1809
Khan 1810
need?” 1811
 1812
“My 1813
quarry. 1814
A 1815
man’s 1816
cub 1817
went 1818
this 1819
way,” 1820
said 1821
Shere 1822
Khan. 1823
“Its 1824
parents 1825
have 1826
run 1827
off. 1828
Give 1829
it 1830
to 1831
me.” 1832
 1833
Shere 1834
Khan 1835
had 1836
jumped 1837
at 1838
a 1839
woodcutter’s 1840
campfire, 1841
as 1842
Father 1843
Wolf 1844
had 1845
said, 1846
and 1847
was 1848
furious 1849
from 1850
the 1851
pain 1852
of 1853
his 1854
burned 1855
feet. 1856
But 1857
Father 1858
Wolf 1859
knew 1860
that 1861
the 1862
mouth 1863
of 1864
the 1865
cave 1866
was 1867
too 1868
narrow 1869
for 1870
a 1871
tiger 1872
to 1873
come 1874
in 1875
by. 1876
Even 1877
where 1878
he 1879
was, 1880
Shere 1881
Khan’s 1882
shoulders 1883
and 1884
forepaws 1885
were 1886
cramped 1887
for 1888
want 1889
of 1890
room, 1891
as 1892
a 1893
man’s 1894
would 1895
be 1896
if 1897
he 1898
tried 1899
to 1900
fight 1901
in 1902
a 1903
barrel. 1904
 1905
“The 1906
Wolves 1907
are 1908
a 1909
free 1910
people,” 1911
said 1912
Father 1913
Wolf. 1914
“They 1915
take 1916
orders 1917
from 1918
the 1919
Head 1920
of 1921
the 1922
Pack, 1923
and 1924
not 1925
from 1926
any 1927
striped 1928
cattle-killer. 1929
The 1930
man’s 1931
cub 1932
is 1933
ours--to 1934
kill 1935
if 1936
we 1937
choose.” 1938
 1939
“Ye 1940
choose 1941
and 1942
ye 1943
do 1944
not 1945
choose! 1946
What 1947
talk 1948
is 1949
this 1950
of 1951
choosing? 1952
By 1953
the 1954
bull 1955
that 1956
I 1957
killed, 1958
am 1959
I 1960
to 1961
stand 1962
nosing 1963
into 1964
your 1965
dog’s 1966
den 1967
for 1968
my 1969
fair 1970
dues? 1971
It 1972
is 1973
I, 1974
Shere 1975
Khan, 1976
who 1977
speak!” 1978
 1979
The 1980
tiger’s 1981
roar 1982
filled 1983
the 1984
cave 1985
with 1986
thunder. 1987
Mother 1988
Wolf 1989
shook 1990
herself 1991
clear 1992
of 1993
the 1994
cubs 1995
and 1996
sprang 1997
forward, 1998
her 1999
eyes, 2000
like 2001
two 2002
green 2003
moons 2004
in 2005
the 2006
darkness, 2007
facing 2008
the 2009
blazing 2010
eyes 2011
of 2012
Shere 2013
Khan. 2014
 2015
“And 2016
it 2017
is 2018
I, 2019
Raksha 2020
[The 2021
Demon], 2022
who 2023
answers. 2024
The 2025
man’s 2026
cub 2027
is 2028
mine, 2029
Lungri--mine 2030
to 2031
me! 2032
He 2033
shall 2034
not 2035
be 2036
killed. 2037
He 2038
shall 2039
live 2040
to 2041
run 2042
with 2043
the 2044
Pack 2045
and 2046
to 2047
hunt 2048
with 2049
the 2050
Pack; 2051
and 2052
in 2053
the 2054
end, 2055
look 2056
you, 2057
hunter 2058
of 2059
little 2060
naked 2061
cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he 2062
shall 2063
hunt 2064
thee! 2065
Now 2066
get 2067
hence, 2068
or 2069
by 2070
the 2071
Sambhur 2072
that 2073
I 2074
killed 2075
(I 2076
eat 2077
no 2078
starved 2079
cattle), 2080
back 2081
thou 2082
goest 2083
to 2084
thy 2085
mother, 2086
burned 2087
beast 2088
of 2089
the 2090
jungle, 2091
lamer 2092
than 2093
ever 2094
thou 2095
camest 2096
into 2097
the 2098
world! 2099
Go!” 2100
 2101
Father 2102
Wolf 2103
looked 2104
on 2105
amazed. 2106
He 2107
had 2108
almost 2109
forgotten 2110
the 2111
days 2112
when 2113
he 2114
won 2115
Mother 2116
Wolf 2117
in 2118
fair 2119
fight 2120
from 2121
five 2122
other 2123
wolves, 2124
when 2125
she 2126
ran 2127
in 2128
the 2129
Pack 2130
and 2131
was 2132
not 2133
called 2134
The 2135
Demon 2136
for 2137
compliment’s 2138
sake. 2139
Shere 2140
Khan 2141
might 2142
have 2143
faced 2144
Father 2145
Wolf, 2146
but 2147
he 2148
could 2149
not 2150
stand 2151
up 2152
against 2153
Mother 2154
Wolf, 2155
for 2156
he 2157
knew 2158
that 2159
where 2160
he 2161
was 2162
she 2163
had 2164
all 2165
the 2166
advantage 2167
of 2168
the 2169
ground, 2170
and 2171
would 2172
fight 2173
to 2174
the 2175
death. 2176
So 2177
he 2178
backed 2179
out 2180
of 2181
the 2182
cave 2183
mouth 2184
growling, 2185
and 2186
when 2187
he 2188
was 2189
clear 2190
he 2191
shouted: 2192
 2193
“Each 2194
dog 2195
barks 2196
in 2197
his 2198
own 2199
yard! 2200
We 2201
will 2202
see 2203
what 2204
the 2205
Pack 2206
will 2207
say 2208
to 2209
this 2210
fostering 2211
of 2212
man-cubs. 2213
The 2214
cub 2215
is 2216
mine, 2217
and 2218
to 2219
my 2220
teeth 2221
he 2222
will 2223
come 2224
in 2225
the 2226
end, 2227
O 2228
bush-tailed 2229
thieves!” 2230
 2231
Mother 2232
Wolf 2233
threw 2234
herself 2235
down 2236
panting 2237
among 2238
the 2239
cubs, 2240
and 2241
Father 2242
Wolf 2243
said 2244
to 2245
her 2246
gravely: 2247
 2248
“Shere 2249
Khan 2250
speaks 2251
this 2252
much 2253
truth. 2254
The 2255
cub 2256
must 2257
be 2258
shown 2259
to 2260
the 2261
Pack. 2262
Wilt 2263
thou 2264
still 2265
keep 2266
him, 2267
Mother?” 2268
 2269
“Keep 2270
him!” 2271
she 2272
gasped. 2273
“He 2274
came 2275
naked, 2276
by 2277
night, 2278
alone 2279
and 2280
very 2281
hungry; 2282
yet 2283
he 2284
was 2285
not 2286
afraid! 2287
Look, 2288
he 2289
has 2290
pushed 2291
one 2292
of 2293
my 2294
babes 2295
to 2296
one 2297
side 2298
already. 2299
And 2300
that 2301
lame 2302
butcher 2303
would 2304
have 2305
killed 2306
him 2307
and 2308
would 2309
have 2310
run 2311
off 2312
to 2313
the 2314
Waingunga 2315
while 2316
the 2317
villagers 2318
here 2319
hunted 2320
through 2321
all 2322
our 2323
lairs 2324
in 2325
revenge! 2326
Keep 2327
him? 2328
Assuredly 2329
I 2330
will 2331
keep 2332
him. 2333
Lie 2334
still, 2335
little 2336
frog. 2337
O 2338
thou 2339
Mowgli--for 2340
Mowgli 2341
the 2342
Frog 2343
I 2344
will 2345
call 2346
thee--the 2347
time 2348
will 2349
come 2350
when 2351
thou 2352
wilt 2353
hunt 2354
Shere 2355
Khan 2356
as 2357
he 2358
has 2359
hunted 2360
thee.” 2361
 2362
“But 2363
what 2364
will 2365
our 2366
Pack 2367
say?” 2368
said 2369
Father 2370
Wolf. 2371
 2372
The 2373
Law 2374
of 2375
the 2376
Jungle 2377
lays 2378
down 2379
very 2380
clearly 2381
that 2382
any 2383
wolf 2384
may, 2385
when 2386
he 2387
marries, 2388
withdraw 2389
from 2390
the 2391
Pack 2392
he 2393
belongs 2394
to. 2395
But 2396
as 2397
soon 2398
as 2399
his 2400
cubs 2401
are 2402
old 2403
enough 2404
to 2405
stand 2406
on 2407
their 2408
feet 2409
he 2410
must 2411
bring 2412
them 2413
to 2414
the 2415
Pack 2416
Council, 2417
which 2418
is 2419
generally 2420
held 2421
once 2422
a 2423
month 2424
at 2425
full 2426
moon, 2427
in 2428
order 2429
that 2430
the 2431
other 2432
wolves 2433
may 2434
identify 2435
them. 2436
After 2437
that 2438
inspection 2439
the 2440
cubs 2441
are 2442
free 2443
to 2444
run 2445
where 2446
they 2447
please, 2448
and 2449
until 2450
they 2451
have 2452
killed 2453
their 2454
first 2455
buck 2456
no 2457
excuse 2458
is 2459
accepted 2460
if 2461
a 2462
grown 2463
wolf 2464
of 2465
the 2466
Pack 2467
kills 2468
one 2469
of 2470
them. 2471
The 2472
punishment 2473
is 2474
death 2475
where 2476
the 2477
murderer 2478
can 2479
be 2480
found; 2481
and 2482
if 2483
you 2484
think 2485
for 2486
a 2487
minute 2488
you 2489
will 2490
see 2491
that 2492
this 2493
must 2494
be 2495
so. 2496
 2497
Father 2498
Wolf 2499
waited 2500
till 2501
his 2502
cubs 2503
could 2504
run 2505
a 2506
little, 2507
and 2508
then 2509
on 2510
the 2511
night 2512
of 2513
the 2514
Pack 2515
Meeting 2516
took 2517
them 2518
and 2519
Mowgli 2520
and 2521
Mother 2522
Wolf 2523
to 2524
the 2525
Council 2526
Rock--a 2527
hilltop 2528
covered 2529
with 2530
stones 2531
and 2532
boulders 2533
where 2534
a 2535
hundred 2536
wolves 2537
could 2538
hide. 2539
Akela, 2540
the 2541
great 2542
gray 2543
Lone 2544
Wolf, 2545
who 2546
led 2547
all 2548
the 2549
Pack 2550
by 2551
strength 2552
and 2553
cunning, 2554
lay 2555
out 2556
at 2557
full 2558
length 2559
on 2560
his 2561
rock, 2562
and 2563
below 2564
him 2565
sat 2566
forty 2567
or 2568
more 2569
wolves 2570
of 2571
every 2572
size 2573
and 2574
color, 2575
from 2576
badger-colored 2577
veterans 2578
who 2579
could 2580
handle 2581
a 2582
buck 2583
alone 2584
to 2585
young 2586
black 2587
three-year-olds 2588
who 2589
thought 2590
they 2591
could. 2592
The 2593
Lone 2594
Wolf 2595
had 2596
led 2597
them 2598
for 2599
a 2600
year 2601
now. 2602
He 2603
had 2604
fallen 2605
twice 2606
into 2607
a 2608
wolf 2609
trap 2610
in 2611
his 2612
youth, 2613
and 2614
once 2615
he 2616
had 2617
been 2618
beaten 2619
and 2620
left 2621
for 2622
dead; 2623
so 2624
he 2625
knew 2626
the 2627
manners 2628
and 2629
customs 2630
of 2631
men. 2632
There 2633
was 2634
very 2635
little 2636
talking 2637
at 2638
the 2639
Rock. 2640
The 2641
cubs 2642
tumbled 2643
over 2644
each 2645
other 2646
in 2647
the 2648
center 2649
of 2650
the 2651
circle 2652
where 2653
their 2654
mothers 2655
and 2656
fathers 2657
sat, 2658
and 2659
now 2660
and 2661
again 2662
a 2663
senior 2664
wolf 2665
would 2666
go 2667
quietly 2668
up 2669
to 2670
a 2671
cub, 2672
look 2673
at 2674
him 2675
carefully, 2676
and 2677
return 2678
to 2679
his 2680
place 2681
on 2682
noiseless 2683
feet. 2684
Sometimes 2685
a 2686
mother 2687
would 2688
push 2689
her 2690
cub 2691
far 2692
out 2693
into 2694
the 2695
moonlight 2696
to 2697
be 2698
sure 2699
that 2700
he 2701
had 2702
not 2703
been 2704
overlooked. 2705
Akela 2706
from 2707
his 2708
rock 2709
would 2710
cry: 2711
“Ye 2712
know 2713
the 2714
Law--ye 2715
know 2716
the 2717
Law. 2718
Look 2719
well, 2720
O 2721
Wolves!” 2722
And 2723
the 2724
anxious 2725
mothers 2726
would 2727
take 2728
up 2729
the 2730
call: 2731
“Look--look 2732
well, 2733
O 2734
Wolves!” 2735
 2736
At 2737
last--and 2738
Mother 2739
Wolf’s 2740
neck 2741
bristles 2742
lifted 2743
as 2744
the 2745
time 2746
came--Father 2747
Wolf 2748
pushed 2749
“Mowgli 2750
the 2751
Frog,” 2752
as 2753
they 2754
called 2755
him, 2756
into 2757
the 2758
center, 2759
where 2760
he 2761
sat 2762
laughing 2763
and 2764
playing 2765
with 2766
some 2767
pebbles 2768
that 2769
glistened 2770
in 2771
the 2772
moonlight. 2773
 2774
Akela 2775
never 2776
raised 2777
his 2778
head 2779
from 2780
his 2781
paws, 2782
but 2783
went 2784
on 2785
with 2786
the 2787
monotonous 2788
cry: 2789
“Look 2790
well!” 2791
A 2792
muffled 2793
roar 2794
came 2795
up 2796
from 2797
behind 2798
the 2799
rocks--the 2800
voice 2801
of 2802
Shere 2803
Khan 2804
crying: 2805
“The 2806
cub 2807
is 2808
mine. 2809
Give 2810
him 2811
to 2812
me. 2813
What 2814
have 2815
the 2816
Free 2817
People 2818
to 2819
do 2820
with 2821
a 2822
man’s 2823
cub?” 2824
Akela 2825
never 2826
even 2827
twitched 2828
his 2829
ears. 2830
All 2831
he 2832
said 2833
was: 2834
“Look 2835
well, 2836
O 2837
Wolves! 2838
What 2839
have 2840
the 2841
Free 2842
People 2843
to 2844
do 2845
with 2846
the 2847
orders 2848
of 2849
any 2850
save 2851
the 2852
Free 2853
People? 2854
Look 2855
well!” 2856
 2857
There 2858
was 2859
a 2860
chorus 2861
of 2862
deep 2863
growls, 2864
and 2865
a 2866
young 2867
wolf 2868
in 2869
his 2870
fourth 2871
year 2872
flung 2873
back 2874
Shere 2875
Khan’s 2876
question 2877
to 2878
Akela: 2879
“What 2880
have 2881
the 2882
Free 2883
People 2884
to 2885
do 2886
with 2887
a 2888
man’s 2889
cub?” 2890
Now, 2891
the 2892
Law 2893
of 2894
the 2895
Jungle 2896
lays 2897
down 2898
that 2899
if 2900
there 2901
is 2902
any 2903
dispute 2904
as 2905
to 2906
the 2907
right 2908
of 2909
a 2910
cub 2911
to 2912
be 2913
accepted 2914
by 2915
the 2916
Pack, 2917
he 2918
must 2919
be 2920
spoken 2921
for 2922
by 2923
at 2924
least 2925
two 2926
members 2927
of 2928
the 2929
Pack 2930
who 2931
are 2932
not 2933
his 2934
father 2935
and 2936
mother. 2937
 2938
“Who 2939
speaks 2940
for 2941
this 2942
cub?” 2943
said 2944
Akela. 2945
“Among 2946
the 2947
Free 2948
People 2949
who 2950
speaks?” 2951
There 2952
was 2953
no 2954
answer 2955
and 2956
Mother 2957
Wolf 2958
got 2959
ready 2960
for 2961
what 2962
she 2963
knew 2964
would 2965
be 2966
her 2967
last 2968
fight, 2969
if 2970
things 2971
came 2972
to 2973
fighting. 2974
 2975
Then 2976
the 2977
only 2978
other 2979
creature 2980
who 2981
is 2982
allowed 2983
at 2984
the 2985
Pack 2986
Council--Baloo, 2987
the 2988
sleepy 2989
brown 2990
bear 2991
who 2992
teaches 2993
the 2994
wolf 2995
cubs 2996
the 2997
Law 2998
of 2999
the 3000
Jungle: 3001
old 3002
Baloo, 3003
who 3004
can 3005
come 3006
and 3007
go 3008
where 3009
he 3010
pleases 3011
because 3012
he 3013
eats 3014
only 3015
nuts 3016
and 3017
roots 3018
and 3019
honey--rose 3020
upon 3021
his 3022
hind 3023
quarters 3024
and 3025
grunted. 3026
 3027
“The 3028
man’s 3029
cub--the 3030
man’s 3031
cub?” 3032
he 3033
said. 3034
“I 3035
speak 3036
for 3037
the 3038
man’s 3039
cub. 3040
There 3041
is 3042
no 3043
harm 3044
in 3045
a 3046
man’s 3047
cub. 3048
I 3049
have 3050
no 3051
gift 3052
of 3053
words, 3054
but 3055
I 3056
speak 3057
the 3058
truth. 3059
Let 3060
him 3061
run 3062
with 3063
the 3064
Pack, 3065
and 3066
be 3067
entered 3068
with 3069
the 3070
others. 3071
I 3072
myself 3073
will 3074
teach 3075
him.” 3076
 3077
“We 3078
need 3079
yet 3080
another,” 3081
said 3082
Akela. 3083
“Baloo 3084
has 3085
spoken, 3086
and 3087
he 3088
is 3089
our 3090
teacher 3091
for 3092
the 3093
young 3094
cubs. 3095
Who 3096
speaks 3097
besides 3098
Baloo?” 3099
 3100
A 3101
black 3102
shadow 3103
dropped 3104
down 3105
into 3106
the 3107
circle. 3108
It 3109
was 3110
Bagheera 3111
the 3112
Black 3113
Panther, 3114
inky 3115
black 3116
all 3117
over, 3118
but 3119
with 3120
the 3121
panther 3122
markings 3123
showing 3124
up 3125
in 3126
certain 3127
lights 3128
like 3129
the 3130
pattern 3131
of 3132
watered 3133
silk. 3134
Everybody 3135
knew 3136
Bagheera, 3137
and 3138
nobody 3139
cared 3140
to 3141
cross 3142
his 3143
path; 3144
for 3145
he 3146
was 3147
as 3148
cunning 3149
as 3150
Tabaqui, 3151
as 3152
bold 3153
as 3154
the 3155
wild 3156
buffalo, 3157
and 3158
as 3159
reckless 3160
as 3161
the 3162
wounded 3163
elephant. 3164
But 3165
he 3166
had 3167
a 3168
voice 3169
as 3170
soft 3171
as 3172
wild 3173
honey 3174
dripping 3175
from 3176
a 3177
tree, 3178
and 3179
a 3180
skin 3181
softer 3182
than 3183
down. 3184
 3185
“O 3186
Akela, 3187
and 3188
ye 3189
the 3190
Free 3191
People,” 3192
he 3193
purred, 3194
“I 3195
have 3196
no 3197
right 3198
in 3199
your 3200
assembly, 3201
but 3202
the 3203
Law 3204
of 3205
the 3206
Jungle 3207
says 3208
that 3209
if 3210
there 3211
is 3212
a 3213
doubt 3214
which 3215
is 3216
not 3217
a 3218
killing 3219
matter 3220
in 3221
regard 3222
to 3223
a 3224
new 3225
cub, 3226
the 3227
life 3228
of 3229
that 3230
cub 3231
may 3232
be 3233
bought 3234
at 3235
a 3236
price. 3237
And 3238
the 3239
Law 3240
does 3241
not 3242
say 3243
who 3244
may 3245
or 3246
may 3247
not 3248
pay 3249
that 3250
price. 3251
Am 3252
I 3253
right?” 3254
 3255
“Good! 3256
Good!” 3257
said 3258
the 3259
young 3260
wolves, 3261
who 3262
are 3263
always 3264
hungry. 3265
“Listen 3266
to 3267
Bagheera. 3268
The 3269
cub 3270
can 3271
be 3272
bought 3273
for 3274
a 3275
price. 3276
It 3277
is 3278
the 3279
Law.” 3280
 3281
“Knowing 3282
that 3283
I 3284
have 3285
no 3286
right 3287
to 3288
speak 3289
here, 3290
I 3291
ask 3292
your 3293
leave.” 3294
 3295
“Speak 3296
then,” 3297
cried 3298
twenty 3299
voices. 3300
 3301
“To 3302
kill 3303
a 3304
naked 3305
cub 3306
is 3307
shame. 3308
Besides, 3309
he 3310
may 3311
make 3312
better 3313
sport 3314
for 3315
you 3316
when 3317
he 3318
is 3319
grown. 3320
Baloo 3321
has 3322
spoken 3323
in 3324
his 3325
behalf. 3326
Now 3327
to 3328
Baloo’s 3329
word 3330
I 3331
will 3332
add 3333
one 3334
bull, 3335
and 3336
a 3337
fat 3338
one, 3339
newly 3340
killed, 3341
not 3342
half 3343
a 3344
mile 3345
from 3346
here, 3347
if 3348
ye 3349
will 3350
accept 3351
the 3352
man’s 3353
cub 3354
according 3355
to 3356
the 3357
Law. 3358
Is 3359
it 3360
difficult?” 3361
 3362
There 3363
was 3364
a 3365
clamor 3366
of 3367
scores 3368
of 3369
voices, 3370
saying: 3371
“What 3372
matter? 3373
He 3374
will 3375
die 3376
in 3377
the 3378
winter 3379
rains. 3380
He 3381
will 3382
scorch 3383
in 3384
the 3385
sun. 3386
What 3387
harm 3388
can 3389
a 3390
naked 3391
frog 3392
do 3393
us? 3394
Let 3395
him 3396
run 3397
with 3398
the 3399
Pack. 3400
Where 3401
is 3402
the 3403
bull, 3404
Bagheera? 3405
Let 3406
him 3407
be 3408
accepted.” 3409
And 3410
then 3411
came 3412
Akela’s 3413
deep 3414
bay, 3415
crying: 3416
“Look 3417
well--look 3418
well, 3419
O 3420
Wolves!” 3421
 3422
Mowgli 3423
was 3424
still 3425
deeply 3426
interested 3427
in 3428
the 3429
pebbles, 3430
and 3431
he 3432
did 3433
not 3434
notice 3435
when 3436
the 3437
wolves 3438
came 3439
and 3440
looked 3441
at 3442
him 3443
one 3444
by 3445
one. 3446
At 3447
last 3448
they 3449
all 3450
went 3451
down 3452
the 3453
hill 3454
for 3455
the 3456
dead 3457
bull, 3458
and 3459
only 3460
Akela, 3461
Bagheera, 3462
Baloo, 3463
and 3464
Mowgli’s 3465
own 3466
wolves 3467
were 3468
left. 3469
Shere 3470
Khan 3471
roared 3472
still 3473
in 3474
the 3475
night, 3476
for 3477
he 3478
was 3479
very 3480
angry 3481
that 3482
Mowgli 3483
had 3484
not 3485
been 3486
handed 3487
over 3488
to 3489
him. 3490
 3491
“Ay, 3492
roar 3493
well,” 3494
said 3495
Bagheera, 3496
under 3497
his 3498
whiskers, 3499
“for 3500
the 3501
time 3502
will 3503
come 3504
when 3505
this 3506
naked 3507
thing 3508
will 3509
make 3510
thee 3511
roar 3512
to 3513
another 3514
tune, 3515
or 3516
I 3517
know 3518
nothing 3519
of 3520
man.” 3521
 3522
“It 3523
was 3524
well 3525
done,” 3526
said 3527
Akela. 3528
“Men 3529
and 3530
their 3531
cubs 3532
are 3533
very 3534
wise. 3535
He 3536
may 3537
be 3538
a 3539
help 3540
in 3541
time.” 3542
 3543
“Truly, 3544
a 3545
help 3546
in 3547
time 3548
of 3549
need; 3550
for 3551
none 3552
can 3553
hope 3554
to 3555
lead 3556
the 3557
Pack 3558
forever,” 3559
said 3560
Bagheera. 3561
 3562
Akela 3563
said 3564
nothing. 3565
He 3566
was 3567
thinking 3568
of 3569
the 3570
time 3571
that 3572
comes 3573
to 3574
every 3575
leader 3576
of 3577
every 3578
pack 3579
when 3580
his 3581
strength 3582
goes 3583
from 3584
him 3585
and 3586
he 3587
gets 3588
feebler 3589
and 3590
feebler, 3591
till 3592
at 3593
last 3594
he 3595
is 3596
killed 3597
by 3598
the 3599
wolves 3600
and 3601
a 3602
new 3603
leader 3604
comes 3605
up--to 3606
be 3607
killed 3608
in 3609
his 3610
turn. 3611
 3612
“Take 3613
him 3614
away,” 3615
he 3616
said 3617
to 3618
Father 3619
Wolf, 3620
“and 3621
train 3622
him 3623
as 3624
befits 3625
one 3626
of 3627
the 3628
Free 3629
People.” 3630
 3631
And 3632
that 3633
is 3634
how 3635
Mowgli 3636
was 3637
entered 3638
into 3639
the 3640
Seeonee 3641
Wolf 3642
Pack 3643
for 3644
the 3645
price 3646
of 3647
a 3648
bull 3649
and 3650
on 3651
Baloo’s 3652
good 3653
word. 3654
 3655
Now 3656
you 3657
must 3658
be 3659
content 3660
to 3661
skip 3662
ten 3663
or 3664
eleven 3665
whole 3666
years, 3667
and 3668
only 3669
guess 3670
at 3671
all 3672
the 3673
wonderful 3674
life 3675
that 3676
Mowgli 3677
led 3678
among 3679
the 3680
wolves, 3681
because 3682
if 3683
it 3684
were 3685
written 3686
out 3687
it 3688
would 3689
fill 3690
ever 3691
so 3692
many 3693
books. 3694
He 3695
grew 3696
up 3697
with 3698
the 3699
cubs, 3700
though 3701
they, 3702
of 3703
course, 3704
were 3705
grown 3706
wolves 3707
almost 3708
before 3709
he 3710
was 3711
a 3712
child. 3713
And 3714
Father 3715
Wolf 3716
taught 3717
him 3718
his 3719
business, 3720
and 3721
the 3722
meaning 3723
of 3724
things 3725
in 3726
the 3727
jungle, 3728
till 3729
every 3730
rustle 3731
in 3732
the 3733
grass, 3734
every 3735
breath 3736
of 3737
the 3738
warm 3739
night 3740
air, 3741
every 3742
note 3743
of 3744
the 3745
owls 3746
above 3747
his 3748
head, 3749
every 3750
scratch 3751
of 3752
a 3753
bat’s 3754
claws 3755
as 3756
it 3757
roosted 3758
for 3759
a 3760
while 3761
in 3762
a 3763
tree, 3764
and 3765
every 3766
splash 3767
of 3768
every 3769
little 3770
fish 3771
jumping 3772
in 3773
a 3774
pool 3775
meant 3776
just 3777
as 3778
much 3779
to 3780
him 3781
as 3782
the 3783
work 3784
of 3785
his 3786
office 3787
means 3788
to 3789
a 3790
business 3791
man. 3792
When 3793
he 3794
was 3795
not 3796
learning 3797
he 3798
sat 3799
out 3800
in 3801
the 3802
sun 3803
and 3804
slept, 3805
and 3806
ate 3807
and 3808
went 3809
to 3810
sleep 3811
again. 3812
When 3813
he 3814
felt 3815
dirty 3816
or 3817
hot 3818
he 3819
swam 3820
in 3821
the 3822
forest 3823
pools; 3824
and 3825
when 3826
he 3827
wanted 3828
honey 3829
(Baloo 3830
told 3831
him 3832
that 3833
honey 3834
and 3835
nuts 3836
were 3837
just 3838
as 3839
pleasant 3840
to 3841
eat 3842
as 3843
raw 3844
meat) 3845
he 3846
climbed 3847
up 3848
for 3849
it, 3850
and 3851
that 3852
Bagheera 3853
showed 3854
him 3855
how 3856
to 3857
do. 3858
Bagheera 3859
would 3860
lie 3861
out 3862
on 3863
a 3864
branch 3865
and 3866
call, 3867
“Come 3868
along, 3869
Little 3870
Brother,” 3871
and 3872
at 3873
first 3874
Mowgli 3875
would 3876
cling 3877
like 3878
the 3879
sloth, 3880
but 3881
afterward 3882
he 3883
would 3884
fling 3885
himself 3886
through 3887
the 3888
branches 3889
almost 3890
as 3891
boldly 3892
as 3893
the 3894
gray 3895
ape. 3896
He 3897
took 3898
his 3899
place 3900
at 3901
the 3902
Council 3903
Rock, 3904
too, 3905
when 3906
the 3907
Pack 3908
met, 3909
and 3910
there 3911
he 3912
discovered 3913
that 3914
if 3915
he 3916
stared 3917
hard 3918
at 3919
any 3920
wolf, 3921
the 3922
wolf 3923
would 3924
be 3925
forced 3926
to 3927
drop 3928
his 3929
eyes, 3930
and 3931
so 3932
he 3933
used 3934
to 3935
stare 3936
for 3937
fun. 3938
At 3939
other 3940
times 3941
he 3942
would 3943
pick 3944
the 3945
long 3946
thorns 3947
out 3948
of 3949
the 3950
pads 3951
of 3952
his 3953
friends, 3954
for 3955
wolves 3956
suffer 3957
terribly 3958
from 3959
thorns 3960
and 3961
burs 3962
in 3963
their 3964
coats. 3965
He 3966
would 3967
go 3968
down 3969
the 3970
hillside 3971
into 3972
the 3973
cultivated 3974
lands 3975
by 3976
night, 3977
and 3978
look 3979
very 3980
curiously 3981
at 3982
the 3983
villagers 3984
in 3985
their 3986
huts, 3987
but 3988
he 3989
had 3990
a 3991
mistrust 3992
of 3993
men 3994
because 3995
Bagheera 3996
showed 3997
him 3998
a 3999
square 4000
box 4001
with 4002
a 4003
drop 4004
gate 4005
so 4006
cunningly 4007
hidden 4008
in 4009
the 4010
jungle 4011
that 4012
he 4013
nearly 4014
walked 4015
into 4016
it, 4017
and 4018
told 4019
him 4020
that 4021
it 4022
was 4023
a 4024
trap. 4025
He 4026
loved 4027
better 4028
than 4029
anything 4030
else 4031
to 4032
go 4033
with 4034
Bagheera 4035
into 4036
the 4037
dark 4038
warm 4039
heart 4040
of 4041
the 4042
forest, 4043
to 4044
sleep 4045
all 4046
through 4047
the 4048
drowsy 4049
day, 4050
and 4051
at 4052
night 4053
see 4054
how 4055
Bagheera 4056
did 4057
his 4058
killing. 4059
Bagheera 4060
killed 4061
right 4062
and 4063
left 4064
as 4065
he 4066
felt 4067
hungry, 4068
and 4069
so 4070
did 4071
Mowgli--with 4072
one 4073
exception. 4074
As 4075
soon 4076
as 4077
he 4078
was 4079
old 4080
enough 4081
to 4082
understand 4083
things, 4084
Bagheera 4085
told 4086
him 4087
that 4088
he 4089
must 4090
never 4091
touch 4092
cattle 4093
because 4094
he 4095
had 4096
been 4097
bought 4098
into 4099
the 4100
Pack 4101
at 4102
the 4103
price 4104
of 4105
a 4106
bull’s 4107
life. 4108
“All 4109
the 4110
jungle 4111
is 4112
thine,” 4113
said 4114
Bagheera, 4115
“and 4116
thou 4117
canst 4118
kill 4119
everything 4120
that 4121
thou 4122
art 4123
strong 4124
enough 4125
to 4126
kill; 4127
but 4128
for 4129
the 4130
sake 4131
of 4132
the 4133
bull 4134
that 4135
bought 4136
thee 4137
thou 4138
must 4139
never 4140
kill 4141
or 4142
eat 4143
any 4144
cattle 4145
young 4146
or 4147
old. 4148
That 4149
is 4150
the 4151
Law 4152
of 4153
the 4154
Jungle.” 4155
Mowgli 4156
obeyed 4157
faithfully. 4158
 4159
And 4160
he 4161
grew 4162
and 4163
grew 4164
strong 4165
as 4166
a 4167
boy 4168
must 4169
grow 4170
who 4171
does 4172
not 4173
know 4174
that 4175
he 4176
is 4177
learning 4178
any 4179
lessons, 4180
and 4181
who 4182
has 4183
nothing 4184
in 4185
the 4186
world 4187
to 4188
think 4189
of 4190
except 4191
things 4192
to 4193
eat. 4194
 4195
Mother 4196
Wolf 4197
told 4198
him 4199
once 4200
or 4201
twice 4202
that 4203
Shere 4204
Khan 4205
was 4206
not 4207
a 4208
creature 4209
to 4210
be 4211
trusted, 4212
and 4213
that 4214
some 4215
day 4216
he 4217
must 4218
kill 4219
Shere 4220
Khan. 4221
But 4222
though 4223
a 4224
young 4225
wolf 4226
would 4227
have 4228
remembered 4229
that 4230
advice 4231
every 4232
hour, 4233
Mowgli 4234
forgot 4235
it 4236
because 4237
he 4238
was 4239
only 4240
a 4241
boy--though 4242
he 4243
would 4244
have 4245
called 4246
himself 4247
a 4248
wolf 4249
if 4250
he 4251
had 4252
been 4253
able 4254
to 4255
speak 4256
in 4257
any 4258
human 4259
tongue. 4260
 4261
Shere 4262
Khan 4263
was 4264
always 4265
crossing 4266
his 4267
path 4268
in 4269
the 4270
jungle, 4271
for 4272
as 4273
Akela 4274
grew 4275
older 4276
and 4277
feebler 4278
the 4279
lame 4280
tiger 4281
had 4282
come 4283
to 4284
be 4285
great 4286
friends 4287
with 4288
the 4289
younger 4290
wolves 4291
of 4292
the 4293
Pack, 4294
who 4295
followed 4296
him 4297
for 4298
scraps, 4299
a 4300
thing 4301
Akela 4302
would 4303
never 4304
have 4305
allowed 4306
if 4307
he 4308
had 4309
dared 4310
to 4311
push 4312
his 4313
authority 4314
to 4315
the 4316
proper 4317
bounds. 4318
Then 4319
Shere 4320
Khan 4321
would 4322
flatter 4323
them 4324
and 4325
wonder 4326
that 4327
such 4328
fine 4329
young 4330
hunters 4331
were 4332
content 4333
to 4334
be 4335
led 4336
by 4337
a 4338
dying 4339
wolf 4340
and 4341
a 4342
man’s 4343
cub. 4344
“They 4345
tell 4346
me,” 4347
Shere 4348
Khan 4349
would 4350
say, 4351
“that 4352
at 4353
Council 4354
ye 4355
dare 4356
not 4357
look 4358
him 4359
between 4360
the 4361
eyes.” 4362
And 4363
the 4364
young 4365
wolves 4366
would 4367
growl 4368
and 4369
bristle. 4370
 4371
Bagheera, 4372
who 4373
had 4374
eyes 4375
and 4376
ears 4377
everywhere, 4378
knew 4379
something 4380
of 4381
this, 4382
and 4383
once 4384
or 4385
twice 4386
he 4387
told 4388
Mowgli 4389
in 4390
so 4391
many 4392
words 4393
that 4394
Shere 4395
Khan 4396
would 4397
kill 4398
him 4399
some 4400
day. 4401
Mowgli 4402
would 4403
laugh 4404
and 4405
answer: 4406
“I 4407
have 4408
the 4409
Pack 4410
and 4411
I 4412
have 4413
thee; 4414
and 4415
Baloo, 4416
though 4417
he 4418
is 4419
so 4420
lazy, 4421
might 4422
strike 4423
a 4424
blow 4425
or 4426
two 4427
for 4428
my 4429
sake. 4430
Why 4431
should 4432
I 4433
be 4434
afraid?” 4435
 4436
It 4437
was 4438
one 4439
very 4440
warm 4441
day 4442
that 4443
a 4444
new 4445
notion 4446
came 4447
to 4448
Bagheera--born 4449
of 4450
something 4451
that 4452
he 4453
had 4454
heard. 4455
Perhaps 4456
Ikki 4457
the 4458
Porcupine 4459
had 4460
told 4461
him; 4462
but 4463
he 4464
said 4465
to 4466
Mowgli 4467
when 4468
they 4469
were 4470
deep 4471
in 4472
the 4473
jungle, 4474
as 4475
the 4476
boy 4477
lay 4478
with 4479
his 4480
head 4481
on 4482
Bagheera’s 4483
beautiful 4484
black 4485
skin, 4486
“Little 4487
Brother, 4488
how 4489
often 4490
have 4491
I 4492
told 4493
thee 4494
that 4495
Shere 4496
Khan 4497
is 4498
thy 4499
enemy?” 4500
 4501
“As 4502
many 4503
times 4504
as 4505
there 4506
are 4507
nuts 4508
on 4509
that 4510
palm,” 4511
said 4512
Mowgli, 4513
who, 4514
naturally, 4515
could 4516
not 4517
count. 4518
“What 4519
of 4520
it? 4521
I 4522
am 4523
sleepy, 4524
Bagheera, 4525
and 4526
Shere 4527
Khan 4528
is 4529
all 4530
long 4531
tail 4532
and 4533
loud 4534
talk--like 4535
Mao, 4536
the 4537
Peacock.” 4538
 4539
“But 4540
this 4541
is 4542
no 4543
time 4544
for 4545
sleeping. 4546
Baloo 4547
knows 4548
it; 4549
I 4550
know 4551
it; 4552
the 4553
Pack 4554
know 4555
it; 4556
and 4557
even 4558
the 4559
foolish, 4560
foolish 4561
deer 4562
know. 4563
Tabaqui 4564
has 4565
told 4566
thee 4567
too.” 4568
 4569
“Ho! 4570
ho!” 4571
said 4572
Mowgli. 4573
“Tabaqui 4574
came 4575
to 4576
me 4577
not 4578
long 4579
ago 4580
with 4581
some 4582
rude 4583
talk 4584
that 4585
I 4586
was 4587
a 4588
naked 4589
man’s 4590
cub 4591
and 4592
not 4593
fit 4594
to 4595
dig 4596
pig-nuts. 4597
But 4598
I 4599
caught 4600
Tabaqui 4601
by 4602
the 4603
tail 4604
and 4605
swung 4606
him 4607
twice 4608
against 4609
a 4610
palm-tree 4611
to 4612
teach 4613
him 4614
better 4615
manners.” 4616
 4617
“That 4618
was 4619
foolishness, 4620
for 4621
though 4622
Tabaqui 4623
is 4624
a 4625
mischief-maker, 4626
he 4627
would 4628
have 4629
told 4630
thee 4631
of 4632
something 4633
that 4634
concerned 4635
thee 4636
closely. 4637
Open 4638
those 4639
eyes, 4640
Little 4641
Brother. 4642
Shere 4643
Khan 4644
dare 4645
not 4646
kill 4647
thee 4648
in 4649
the 4650
jungle. 4651
But 4652
remember, 4653
Akela 4654
is 4655
very 4656
old, 4657
and 4658
soon 4659
the 4660
day 4661
comes 4662
when 4663
he 4664
cannot 4665
kill 4666
his 4667
buck, 4668
and 4669
then 4670
he 4671
will 4672
be 4673
leader 4674
no 4675
more. 4676
Many 4677
of 4678
the 4679
wolves 4680
that 4681
looked 4682
thee 4683
over 4684
when 4685
thou 4686
wast 4687
brought 4688
to 4689
the 4690
Council 4691
first 4692
are 4693
old 4694
too, 4695
and 4696
the 4697
young 4698
wolves 4699
believe, 4700
as 4701
Shere 4702
Khan 4703
has 4704
taught 4705
them, 4706
that 4707
a 4708
man-cub 4709
has 4710
no 4711
place 4712
with 4713
the 4714
Pack. 4715
In 4716
a 4717
little 4718
time 4719
thou 4720
wilt 4721
be 4722
a 4723
man.” 4724
 4725
“And 4726
what 4727
is 4728
a 4729
man 4730
that 4731
he 4732
should 4733
not 4734
run 4735
with 4736
his 4737
brothers?” 4738
said 4739
Mowgli. 4740
“I 4741
was 4742
born 4743
in 4744
the 4745
jungle. 4746
I 4747
have 4748
obeyed 4749
the 4750
Law 4751
of 4752
the 4753
Jungle, 4754
and 4755
there 4756
is 4757
no 4758
wolf 4759
of 4760
ours 4761
from 4762
whose 4763
paws 4764
I 4765
have 4766
not 4767
pulled 4768
a 4769
thorn. 4770
Surely 4771
they 4772
are 4773
my 4774
brothers!” 4775
 4776
Bagheera 4777
stretched 4778
himself 4779
at 4780
full 4781
length 4782
and 4783
half 4784
shut 4785
his 4786
eyes. 4787
“Little 4788
Brother,” 4789
said 4790
he, 4791
“feel 4792
under 4793
my 4794
jaw.” 4795
 4796
Mowgli 4797
put 4798
up 4799
his 4800
strong 4801
brown 4802
hand, 4803
and 4804
just 4805
under 4806
Bagheera’s 4807
silky 4808
chin, 4809
where 4810
the 4811
giant 4812
rolling 4813
muscles 4814
were 4815
all 4816
hid 4817
by 4818
the 4819
glossy 4820
hair, 4821
he 4822
came 4823
upon 4824
a 4825
little 4826
bald 4827
spot. 4828
 4829
“There 4830
is 4831
no 4832
one 4833
in 4834
the 4835
jungle 4836
that 4837
knows 4838
that 4839
I, 4840
Bagheera, 4841
carry 4842
that 4843
mark--the 4844
mark 4845
of 4846
the 4847
collar; 4848
and 4849
yet, 4850
Little 4851
Brother, 4852
I 4853
was 4854
born 4855
among 4856
men, 4857
and 4858
it 4859
was 4860
among 4861
men 4862
that 4863
my 4864
mother 4865
died--in 4866
the 4867
cages 4868
of 4869
the 4870
king’s 4871
palace 4872
at 4873
Oodeypore. 4874
It 4875
was 4876
because 4877
of 4878
this 4879
that 4880
I 4881
paid 4882
the 4883
price 4884
for 4885
thee 4886
at 4887
the 4888
Council 4889
when 4890
thou 4891
wast 4892
a 4893
little 4894
naked 4895
cub. 4896
Yes, 4897
I 4898
too 4899
was 4900
born 4901
among 4902
men. 4903
I 4904
had 4905
never 4906
seen 4907
the 4908
jungle. 4909
They 4910
fed 4911
me 4912
behind 4913
bars 4914
from 4915
an 4916
iron 4917
pan 4918
till 4919
one 4920
night 4921
I 4922
felt 4923
that 4924
I 4925
was 4926
Bagheera--the 4927
Panther--and 4928
no 4929
man’s 4930
plaything, 4931
and 4932
I 4933
broke 4934
the 4935
silly 4936
lock 4937
with 4938
one 4939
blow 4940
of 4941
my 4942
paw 4943
and 4944
came 4945
away. 4946
And 4947
because 4948
I 4949
had 4950
learned 4951
the 4952
ways 4953
of 4954
men, 4955
I 4956
became 4957
more 4958
terrible 4959
in 4960
the 4961
jungle 4962
than 4963
Shere 4964
Khan. 4965
Is 4966
it 4967
not 4968
so?” 4969
 4970
“Yes,” 4971
said 4972
Mowgli, 4973
“all 4974
the 4975
jungle 4976
fear 4977
Bagheera--all 4978
except 4979
Mowgli.” 4980
 4981
“Oh, 4982
thou 4983
art 4984
a 4985
man’s 4986
cub,” 4987
said 4988
the 4989
Black 4990
Panther 4991
very 4992
tenderly. 4993
“And 4994
even 4995
as 4996
I 4997
returned 4998
to 4999
my 5000
jungle, 5001
so 5002
thou 5003
must 5004
go 5005
back 5006
to 5007
men 5008
at 5009
last--to 5010
the 5011
men 5012
who 5013
are 5014
thy 5015
brothers--if 5016
thou 5017
art 5018
not 5019
killed 5020
in 5021
the 5022
Council.” 5023
 5024
“But 5025
why--but 5026
why 5027
should 5028
any 5029
wish 5030
to 5031
kill 5032
me?” 5033
said 5034
Mowgli. 5035
 5036
“Look 5037
at 5038
me,” 5039
said 5040
Bagheera. 5041
And 5042
Mowgli 5043
looked 5044
at 5045
him 5046
steadily 5047
between 5048
the 5049
eyes. 5050
The 5051
big 5052
panther 5053
turned 5054
his 5055
head 5056
away 5057
in 5058
half 5059
a 5060
minute. 5061
 5062
“That 5063
is 5064
why,” 5065
he 5066
said, 5067
shifting 5068
his 5069
paw 5070
on 5071
the 5072
leaves. 5073
“Not 5074
even 5075
I 5076
can 5077
look 5078
thee 5079
between 5080
the 5081
eyes, 5082
and 5083
I 5084
was 5085
born 5086
among 5087
men, 5088
and 5089
I 5090
love 5091
thee, 5092
Little 5093
Brother. 5094
The 5095
others 5096
they 5097
hate 5098
thee 5099
because 5100
their 5101
eyes 5102
cannot 5103
meet 5104
thine; 5105
because 5106
thou 5107
art 5108
wise; 5109
because 5110
thou 5111
hast 5112
pulled 5113
out 5114
thorns 5115
from 5116
their 5117
feet--because 5118
thou 5119
art 5120
a 5121
man.” 5122
 5123
“I 5124
did 5125
not 5126
know 5127
these 5128
things,” 5129
said 5130
Mowgli 5131
sullenly, 5132
and 5133
he 5134
frowned 5135
under 5136
his 5137
heavy 5138
black 5139
eyebrows. 5140
 5141
“What 5142
is 5143
the 5144
Law 5145
of 5146
the 5147
Jungle? 5148
Strike 5149
first 5150
and 5151
then 5152
give 5153
tongue. 5154
By 5155
thy 5156
very 5157
carelessness 5158
they 5159
know 5160
that 5161
thou 5162
art 5163
a 5164
man. 5165
But 5166
be 5167
wise. 5168
It 5169
is 5170
in 5171
my 5172
heart 5173
that 5174
when 5175
Akela 5176
misses 5177
his 5178
next 5179
kill--and 5180
at 5181
each 5182
hunt 5183
it 5184
costs 5185
him 5186
more 5187
to 5188
pin 5189
the 5190
buck--the 5191
Pack 5192
will 5193
turn 5194
against 5195
him 5196
and 5197
against 5198
thee. 5199
They 5200
will 5201
hold 5202
a 5203
jungle 5204
Council 5205
at 5206
the 5207
Rock, 5208
and 5209
then--and 5210
then--I 5211
have 5212
it!” 5213
said 5214
Bagheera, 5215
leaping 5216
up. 5217
“Go 5218
thou 5219
down 5220
quickly 5221
to 5222
the 5223
men’s 5224
huts 5225
in 5226
the 5227
valley, 5228
and 5229
take 5230
some 5231
of 5232
the 5233
Red 5234
Flower 5235
which 5236
they 5237
grow 5238
there, 5239
so 5240
that 5241
when 5242
the 5243
time 5244
comes 5245
thou 5246
mayest 5247
have 5248
even 5249
a 5250
stronger 5251
friend 5252
than 5253
I 5254
or 5255
Baloo 5256
or 5257
those 5258
of 5259
the 5260
Pack 5261
that 5262
love 5263
thee. 5264
Get 5265
the 5266
Red 5267
Flower.” 5268
 5269
By 5270
Red 5271
Flower 5272
Bagheera 5273
meant 5274
fire, 5275
only 5276
no 5277
creature 5278
in 5279
the 5280
jungle 5281
will 5282
call 5283
fire 5284
by 5285
its 5286
proper 5287
name. 5288
Every 5289
beast 5290
lives 5291
in 5292
deadly 5293
fear 5294
of 5295
it, 5296
and 5297
invents 5298
a 5299
hundred 5300
ways 5301
of 5302
describing 5303
it. 5304
 5305
“The 5306
Red 5307
Flower?” 5308
said 5309
Mowgli. 5310
“That 5311
grows 5312
outside 5313
their 5314
huts 5315
in 5316
the 5317
twilight. 5318
I 5319
will 5320
get 5321
some.” 5322
 5323
“There 5324
speaks 5325
the 5326
man’s 5327
cub,” 5328
said 5329
Bagheera 5330
proudly. 5331
“Remember 5332
that 5333
it 5334
grows 5335
in 5336
little 5337
pots. 5338
Get 5339
one 5340
swiftly, 5341
and 5342
keep 5343
it 5344
by 5345
thee 5346
for 5347
time 5348
of 5349
need.” 5350
 5351
“Good!” 5352
said 5353
Mowgli. 5354
“I 5355
go. 5356
But 5357
art 5358
thou 5359
sure, 5360
O 5361
my 5362
Bagheera”--he 5363
slipped 5364
his 5365
arm 5366
around 5367
the 5368
splendid 5369
neck 5370
and 5371
looked 5372
deep 5373
into 5374
the 5375
big 5376
eyes--“art 5377
thou 5378
sure 5379
that 5380
all 5381
this 5382
is 5383
Shere 5384
Khan’s 5385
doing?” 5386
 5387
“By 5388
the 5389
Broken 5390
Lock 5391
that 5392
freed 5393
me, 5394
I 5395
am 5396
sure, 5397
Little 5398
Brother.” 5399
 5400
“Then, 5401
by 5402
the 5403
Bull 5404
that 5405
bought 5406
me, 5407
I 5408
will 5409
pay 5410
Shere 5411
Khan 5412
full 5413
tale 5414
for 5415
this, 5416
and 5417
it 5418
may 5419
be 5420
a 5421
little 5422
over,” 5423
said 5424
Mowgli, 5425
and 5426
he 5427
bounded 5428
away. 5429
 5430
“That 5431
is 5432
a 5433
man. 5434
That 5435
is 5436
all 5437
a 5438
man,” 5439
said 5440
Bagheera 5441
to 5442
himself, 5443
lying 5444
down 5445
again. 5446
“Oh, 5447
Shere 5448
Khan, 5449
never 5450
was 5451
a 5452
blacker 5453
hunting 5454
than 5455
that 5456
frog-hunt 5457
of 5458
thine 5459
ten 5460
years 5461
ago!” 5462
 5463
Mowgli 5464
was 5465
far 5466
and 5467
far 5468
through 5469
the 5470
forest, 5471
running 5472
hard, 5473
and 5474
his 5475
heart 5476
was 5477
hot 5478
in 5479
him. 5480
He 5481
came 5482
to 5483
the 5484
cave 5485
as 5486
the 5487
evening 5488
mist 5489
rose, 5490
and 5491
drew 5492
breath, 5493
and 5494
looked 5495
down 5496
the 5497
valley. 5498
The 5499
cubs 5500
were 5501
out, 5502
but 5503
Mother 5504
Wolf, 5505
at 5506
the 5507
back 5508
of 5509
the 5510
cave, 5511
knew 5512
by 5513
his 5514
breathing 5515
that 5516
something 5517
was 5518
troubling 5519
her 5520
frog. 5521
 5522
“What 5523
is 5524
it, 5525
Son?” 5526
she 5527
said. 5528
 5529
“Some 5530
bat’s 5531
chatter 5532
of 5533
Shere 5534
Khan,” 5535
he 5536
called 5537
back. 5538
“I 5539
hunt 5540
among 5541
the 5542
plowed 5543
fields 5544
tonight,” 5545
and 5546
he 5547
plunged 5548
downward 5549
through 5550
the 5551
bushes, 5552
to 5553
the 5554
stream 5555
at 5556
the 5557
bottom 5558
of 5559
the 5560
valley. 5561
There 5562
he 5563
checked, 5564
for 5565
he 5566
heard 5567
the 5568
yell 5569
of 5570
the 5571
Pack 5572
hunting, 5573
heard 5574
the 5575
bellow 5576
of 5577
a 5578
hunted 5579
Sambhur, 5580
and 5581
the 5582
snort 5583
as 5584
the 5585
buck 5586
turned 5587
at 5588
bay. 5589
Then 5590
there 5591
were 5592
wicked, 5593
bitter 5594
howls 5595
from 5596
the 5597
young 5598
wolves: 5599
“Akela! 5600
Akela! 5601
Let 5602
the 5603
Lone 5604
Wolf 5605
show 5606
his 5607
strength. 5608
Room 5609
for 5610
the 5611
leader 5612
of 5613
the 5614
Pack! 5615
Spring, 5616
Akela!” 5617
 5618
The 5619
Lone 5620
Wolf 5621
must 5622
have 5623
sprung 5624
and 5625
missed 5626
his 5627
hold, 5628
for 5629
Mowgli 5630
heard 5631
the 5632
snap 5633
of 5634
his 5635
teeth 5636
and 5637
then 5638
a 5639
yelp 5640
as 5641
the 5642
Sambhur 5643
knocked 5644
him 5645
over 5646
with 5647
his 5648
forefoot. 5649
 5650
He 5651
did 5652
not 5653
wait 5654
for 5655
anything 5656
more, 5657
but 5658
dashed 5659
on; 5660
and 5661
the 5662
yells 5663
grew 5664
fainter 5665
behind 5666
him 5667
as 5668
he 5669
ran 5670
into 5671
the 5672
croplands 5673
where 5674
the 5675
villagers 5676
lived. 5677
 5678
“Bagheera 5679
spoke 5680
truth,” 5681
he 5682
panted, 5683
as 5684
he 5685
nestled 5686
down 5687
in 5688
some 5689
cattle 5690
fodder 5691
by 5692
the 5693
window 5694
of 5695
a 5696
hut. 5697
“To-morrow 5698
is 5699
one 5700
day 5701
both 5702
for 5703
Akela 5704
and 5705
for 5706
me.” 5707
 5708
Then 5709
he 5710
pressed 5711
his 5712
face 5713
close 5714
to 5715
the 5716
window 5717
and 5718
watched 5719
the 5720
fire 5721
on 5722
the 5723
hearth. 5724
He 5725
saw 5726
the 5727
husbandman’s 5728
wife 5729
get 5730
up 5731
and 5732
feed 5733
it 5734
in 5735
the 5736
night 5737
with 5738
black 5739
lumps. 5740
And 5741
when 5742
the 5743
morning 5744
came 5745
and 5746
the 5747
mists 5748
were 5749
all 5750
white 5751
and 5752
cold, 5753
he 5754
saw 5755
the 5756
man’s 5757
child 5758
pick 5759
up 5760
a 5761
wicker 5762
pot 5763
plastered 5764
inside 5765
with 5766
earth, 5767
fill 5768
it 5769
with 5770
lumps 5771
of 5772
red-hot 5773
charcoal, 5774
put 5775
it 5776
under 5777
his 5778
blanket, 5779
and 5780
go 5781
out 5782
to 5783
tend 5784
the 5785
cows 5786
in 5787
the 5788
byre. 5789
 5790
“Is 5791
that 5792
all?” 5793
said 5794
Mowgli. 5795
“If 5796
a 5797
cub 5798
can 5799
do 5800
it, 5801
there 5802
is 5803
nothing 5804
to 5805
fear.” 5806
So 5807
he 5808
strode 5809
round 5810
the 5811
corner 5812
and 5813
met 5814
the 5815
boy, 5816
took 5817
the 5818
pot 5819
from 5820
his 5821
hand, 5822
and 5823
disappeared 5824
into 5825
the 5826
mist 5827
while 5828
the 5829
boy 5830
howled 5831
with 5832
fear. 5833
 5834
“They 5835
are 5836
very 5837
like 5838
me,” 5839
said 5840
Mowgli, 5841
blowing 5842
into 5843
the 5844
pot 5845
as 5846
he 5847
had 5848
seen 5849
the 5850
woman 5851
do. 5852
“This 5853
thing 5854
will 5855
die 5856
if 5857
I 5858
do 5859
not 5860
give 5861
it 5862
things 5863
to 5864
eat”; 5865
and 5866
he 5867
dropped 5868
twigs 5869
and 5870
dried 5871
bark 5872
on 5873
the 5874
red 5875
stuff. 5876
Halfway 5877
up 5878
the 5879
hill 5880
he 5881
met 5882
Bagheera 5883
with 5884
the 5885
morning 5886
dew 5887
shining 5888
like 5889
moonstones 5890
on 5891
his 5892
coat. 5893
 5894
“Akela 5895
has 5896
missed,” 5897
said 5898
the 5899
Panther. 5900
“They 5901
would 5902
have 5903
killed 5904
him 5905
last 5906
night, 5907
but 5908
they 5909
needed 5910
thee 5911
also. 5912
They 5913
were 5914
looking 5915
for 5916
thee 5917
on 5918
the 5919
hill.” 5920
 5921
“I 5922
was 5923
among 5924
the 5925
plowed 5926
lands. 5927
I 5928
am 5929
ready. 5930
See!” 5931
Mowgli 5932
held 5933
up 5934
the 5935
fire-pot. 5936
 5937
“Good! 5938
Now, 5939
I 5940
have 5941
seen 5942
men 5943
thrust 5944
a 5945
dry 5946
branch 5947
into 5948
that 5949
stuff, 5950
and 5951
presently 5952
the 5953
Red 5954
Flower 5955
blossomed 5956
at 5957
the 5958
end 5959
of 5960
it. 5961
Art 5962
thou 5963
not 5964
afraid?” 5965
 5966
“No. 5967
Why 5968
should 5969
I 5970
fear? 5971
I 5972
remember 5973
now--if 5974
it 5975
is 5976
not 5977
a 5978
dream--how, 5979
before 5980
I 5981
was 5982
a 5983
Wolf, 5984
I 5985
lay 5986
beside 5987
the 5988
Red 5989
Flower, 5990
and 5991
it 5992
was 5993
warm 5994
and 5995
pleasant.” 5996
 5997
All 5998
that 5999
day 6000
Mowgli 6001
sat 6002
in 6003
the 6004
cave 6005
tending 6006
his 6007
fire 6008
pot 6009
and 6010
dipping 6011
dry 6012
branches 6013
into 6014
it 6015
to 6016
see 6017
how 6018
they 6019
looked. 6020
He 6021
found 6022
a 6023
branch 6024
that 6025
satisfied 6026
him, 6027
and 6028
in 6029
the 6030
evening 6031
when 6032
Tabaqui 6033
came 6034
to 6035
the 6036
cave 6037
and 6038
told 6039
him 6040
rudely 6041
enough 6042
that 6043
he 6044
was 6045
wanted 6046
at 6047
the 6048
Council 6049
Rock, 6050
he 6051
laughed 6052
till 6053
Tabaqui 6054
ran 6055
away. 6056
Then 6057
Mowgli 6058
went 6059
to 6060
the 6061
Council, 6062
still 6063
laughing. 6064
 6065
Akela 6066
the 6067
Lone 6068
Wolf 6069
lay 6070
by 6071
the 6072
side 6073
of 6074
his 6075
rock 6076
as 6077
a 6078
sign 6079
that 6080
the 6081
leadership 6082
of 6083
the 6084
Pack 6085
was 6086
open, 6087
and 6088
Shere 6089
Khan 6090
with 6091
his 6092
following 6093
of 6094
scrap-fed 6095
wolves 6096
walked 6097
to 6098
and 6099
fro 6100
openly 6101
being 6102
flattered. 6103
Bagheera 6104
lay 6105
close 6106
to 6107
Mowgli, 6108
and 6109
the 6110
fire 6111
pot 6112
was 6113
between 6114
Mowgli’s 6115
knees. 6116
When 6117
they 6118
were 6119
all 6120
gathered 6121
together, 6122
Shere 6123
Khan 6124
began 6125
to 6126
speak--a 6127
thing 6128
he 6129
would 6130
never 6131
have 6132
dared 6133
to 6134
do 6135
when 6136
Akela 6137
was 6138
in 6139
his 6140
prime. 6141
 6142
“He 6143
has 6144
no 6145
right,” 6146
whispered 6147
Bagheera. 6148
“Say 6149
so. 6150
He 6151
is 6152
a 6153
dog’s 6154
son. 6155
He 6156
will 6157
be 6158
frightened.” 6159
 6160
Mowgli 6161
sprang 6162
to 6163
his 6164
feet. 6165
“Free 6166
People,” 6167
he 6168
cried, 6169
“does 6170
Shere 6171
Khan 6172
lead 6173
the 6174
Pack? 6175
What 6176
has 6177
a 6178
tiger 6179
to 6180
do 6181
with 6182
our 6183
leadership?” 6184
 6185
“Seeing 6186
that 6187
the 6188
leadership 6189
is 6190
yet 6191
open, 6192
and 6193
being 6194
asked 6195
to 6196
speak--” 6197
 6198
Shere 6199
Khan 6200
began. 6201
 6202
“By 6203
whom?” 6204
said 6205
Mowgli. 6206
“Are 6207
we 6208
all 6209
jackals, 6210
to 6211
fawn 6212
on 6213
this 6214
cattle 6215
butcher? 6216
The 6217
leadership 6218
of 6219
the 6220
Pack 6221
is 6222
with 6223
the 6224
Pack 6225
alone.” 6226
 6227
There 6228
were 6229
yells 6230
of 6231
“Silence, 6232
thou 6233
man’s 6234
cub!” 6235
“Let 6236
him 6237
speak. 6238
He 6239
has 6240
kept 6241
our 6242
Law”; 6243
and 6244
at 6245
last 6246
the 6247
seniors 6248
of 6249
the 6250
Pack 6251
thundered: 6252
“Let 6253
the 6254
Dead 6255
Wolf 6256
speak.” 6257
When 6258
a 6259
leader 6260
of 6261
the 6262
Pack 6263
has 6264
missed 6265
his 6266
kill, 6267
he 6268
is 6269
called 6270
the 6271
Dead 6272
Wolf 6273
as 6274
long 6275
as 6276
he 6277
lives, 6278
which 6279
is 6280
not 6281
long. 6282
 6283
Akela 6284
raised 6285
his 6286
old 6287
head 6288
wearily:-- 6289
 6290
“Free 6291
People, 6292
and 6293
ye 6294
too, 6295
jackals 6296
of 6297
Shere 6298
Khan, 6299
for 6300
twelve 6301
seasons 6302
I 6303
have 6304
led 6305
ye 6306
to 6307
and 6308
from 6309
the 6310
kill, 6311
and 6312
in 6313
all 6314
that 6315
time 6316
not 6317
one 6318
has 6319
been 6320
trapped 6321
or 6322
maimed. 6323
Now 6324
I 6325
have 6326
missed 6327
my 6328
kill. 6329
Ye 6330
know 6331
how 6332
that 6333
plot 6334
was 6335
made. 6336
Ye 6337
know 6338
how 6339
ye 6340
brought 6341
me 6342
up 6343
to 6344
an 6345
untried 6346
buck 6347
to 6348
make 6349
my 6350
weakness 6351
known. 6352
It 6353
was 6354
cleverly 6355
done. 6356
Your 6357
right 6358
is 6359
to 6360
kill 6361
me 6362
here 6363
on 6364
the 6365
Council 6366
Rock, 6367
now. 6368
Therefore, 6369
I 6370
ask, 6371
who 6372
comes 6373
to 6374
make 6375
an 6376
end 6377
of 6378
the 6379
Lone 6380
Wolf? 6381
For 6382
it 6383
is 6384
my 6385
right, 6386
by 6387
the 6388
Law 6389
of 6390
the 6391
Jungle, 6392
that 6393
ye 6394
come 6395
one 6396
by 6397
one.” 6398
 6399
There 6400
was 6401
a 6402
long 6403
hush, 6404
for 6405
no 6406
single 6407
wolf 6408
cared 6409
to 6410
fight 6411
Akela 6412
to 6413
the 6414
death. 6415
Then 6416
Shere 6417
Khan 6418
roared: 6419
“Bah! 6420
What 6421
have 6422
we 6423
to 6424
do 6425
with 6426
this 6427
toothless 6428
fool? 6429
He 6430
is 6431
doomed 6432
to 6433
die! 6434
It 6435
is 6436
the 6437
man-cub 6438
who 6439
has 6440
lived 6441
too 6442
long. 6443
Free 6444
People, 6445
he 6446
was 6447
my 6448
meat 6449
from 6450
the 6451
first. 6452
Give 6453
him 6454
to 6455
me. 6456
I 6457
am 6458
weary 6459
of 6460
this 6461
man-wolf 6462
folly. 6463
He 6464
has 6465
troubled 6466
the 6467
jungle 6468
for 6469
ten 6470
seasons. 6471
Give 6472
me 6473
the 6474
man-cub, 6475
or 6476
I 6477
will 6478
hunt 6479
here 6480
always, 6481
and 6482
not 6483
give 6484
you 6485
one 6486
bone. 6487
He 6488
is 6489
a 6490
man, 6491
a 6492
man’s 6493
child, 6494
and 6495
from 6496
the 6497
marrow 6498
of 6499
my 6500
bones 6501
I 6502
hate 6503
him!” 6504
 6505
Then 6506
more 6507
than 6508
half 6509
the 6510
Pack 6511
yelled: 6512
“A 6513
man! 6514
A 6515
man! 6516
What 6517
has 6518
a 6519
man 6520
to 6521
do 6522
with 6523
us? 6524
Let 6525
him 6526
go 6527
to 6528
his 6529
own 6530
place.” 6531
 6532
“And 6533
turn 6534
all 6535
the 6536
people 6537
of 6538
the 6539
villages 6540
against 6541
us?” 6542
clamored 6543
Shere 6544
Khan. 6545
“No, 6546
give 6547
him 6548
to 6549
me. 6550
He 6551
is 6552
a 6553
man, 6554
and 6555
none 6556
of 6557
us 6558
can 6559
look 6560
him 6561
between 6562
the 6563
eyes.” 6564
 6565
Akela 6566
lifted 6567
his 6568
head 6569
again 6570
and 6571
said, 6572
“He 6573
has 6574
eaten 6575
our 6576
food. 6577
He 6578
has 6579
slept 6580
with 6581
us. 6582
He 6583
has 6584
driven 6585
game 6586
for 6587
us. 6588
He 6589
has 6590
broken 6591
no 6592
word 6593
of 6594
the 6595
Law 6596
of 6597
the 6598
Jungle.” 6599
 6600
“Also, 6601
I 6602
paid 6603
for 6604
him 6605
with 6606
a 6607
bull 6608
when 6609
he 6610
was 6611
accepted. 6612
The 6613
worth 6614
of 6615
a 6616
bull 6617
is 6618
little, 6619
but 6620
Bagheera’s 6621
honor 6622
is 6623
something 6624
that 6625
he 6626
will 6627
perhaps 6628
fight 6629
for,” 6630
said 6631
Bagheera 6632
in 6633
his 6634
gentlest 6635
voice. 6636
 6637
“A 6638
bull 6639
paid 6640
ten 6641
years 6642
ago!” 6643
the 6644
Pack 6645
snarled. 6646
“What 6647
do 6648
we 6649
care 6650
for 6651
bones 6652
ten 6653
years 6654
old?” 6655
 6656
“Or 6657
for 6658
a 6659
pledge?” 6660
said 6661
Bagheera, 6662
his 6663
white 6664
teeth 6665
bared 6666
under 6667
his 6668
lip. 6669
“Well 6670
are 6671
ye 6672
called 6673
the 6674
Free 6675
People!” 6676
 6677
“No 6678
man’s 6679
cub 6680
can 6681
run 6682
with 6683
the 6684
people 6685
of 6686
the 6687
jungle,” 6688
howled 6689
Shere 6690
Khan. 6691
“Give 6692
him 6693
to 6694
me!” 6695
 6696
“He 6697
is 6698
our 6699
brother 6700
in 6701
all 6702
but 6703
blood,” 6704
Akela 6705
went 6706
on, 6707
“and 6708
ye 6709
would 6710
kill 6711
him 6712
here! 6713
In 6714
truth, 6715
I 6716
have 6717
lived 6718
too 6719
long. 6720
Some 6721
of 6722
ye 6723
are 6724
eaters 6725
of 6726
cattle, 6727
and 6728
of 6729
others 6730
I 6731
have 6732
heard 6733
that, 6734
under 6735
Shere 6736
Khan’s 6737
teaching, 6738
ye 6739
go 6740
by 6741
dark 6742
night 6743
and 6744
snatch 6745
children 6746
from 6747
the 6748
villager’s 6749
doorstep. 6750
Therefore 6751
I 6752
know 6753
ye 6754
to 6755
be 6756
cowards, 6757
and 6758
it 6759
is 6760
to 6761
cowards 6762
I 6763
speak. 6764
It 6765
is 6766
certain 6767
that 6768
I 6769
must 6770
die, 6771
and 6772
my 6773
life 6774
is 6775
of 6776
no 6777
worth, 6778
or 6779
I 6780
would 6781
offer 6782
that 6783
in 6784
the 6785
man-cub’s 6786
place. 6787
But 6788
for 6789
the 6790
sake 6791
of 6792
the 6793
Honor 6794
of 6795
the 6796
Pack,--a 6797
little 6798
matter 6799
that 6800
by 6801
being 6802
without 6803
a 6804
leader 6805
ye 6806
have 6807
forgotten,--I 6808
promise 6809
that 6810
if 6811
ye 6812
let 6813
the 6814
man-cub 6815
go 6816
to 6817
his 6818
own 6819
place, 6820
I 6821
will 6822
not, 6823
when 6824
my 6825
time 6826
comes 6827
to 6828
die, 6829
bare 6830
one 6831
tooth 6832
against 6833
ye. 6834
I 6835
will 6836
die 6837
without 6838
fighting. 6839
That 6840
will 6841
at 6842
least 6843
save 6844
the 6845
Pack 6846
three 6847
lives. 6848
More 6849
I 6850
cannot 6851
do; 6852
but 6853
if 6854
ye 6855
will, 6856
I 6857
can 6858
save 6859
ye 6860
the 6861
shame 6862
that 6863
comes 6864
of 6865
killing 6866
a 6867
brother 6868
against 6869
whom 6870
there 6871
is 6872
no 6873
fault--a 6874
brother 6875
spoken 6876
for 6877
and 6878
bought 6879
into 6880
the 6881
Pack 6882
according 6883
to 6884
the 6885
Law 6886
of 6887
the 6888
Jungle.” 6889
 6890
“He 6891
is 6892
a 6893
man--a 6894
man--a 6895
man!” 6896
snarled 6897
the 6898
Pack. 6899
And 6900
most 6901
of 6902
the 6903
wolves 6904
began 6905
to 6906
gather 6907
round 6908
Shere 6909
Khan, 6910
whose 6911
tail 6912
was 6913
beginning 6914
to 6915
switch. 6916
 6917
“Now 6918
the 6919
business 6920
is 6921
in 6922
thy 6923
hands,” 6924
said 6925
Bagheera 6926
to 6927
Mowgli. 6928
“We 6929
can 6930
do 6931
no 6932
more 6933
except 6934
fight.” 6935
 6936
Mowgli 6937
stood 6938
upright--the 6939
fire 6940
pot 6941
in 6942
his 6943
hands. 6944
Then 6945
he 6946
stretched 6947
out 6948
his 6949
arms, 6950
and 6951
yawned 6952
in 6953
the 6954
face 6955
of 6956
the 6957
Council; 6958
but 6959
he 6960
was 6961
furious 6962
with 6963
rage 6964
and 6965
sorrow, 6966
for, 6967
wolflike, 6968
the 6969
wolves 6970
had 6971
never 6972
told 6973
him 6974
how 6975
they 6976
hated 6977
him. 6978
“Listen 6979
you!” 6980
he 6981
cried. 6982
“There 6983
is 6984
no 6985
need 6986
for 6987
this 6988
dog’s 6989
jabber. 6990
Ye 6991
have 6992
told 6993
me 6994
so 6995
often 6996
tonight 6997
that 6998
I 6999
am 7000
a 7001
man 7002
(and 7003
indeed 7004
I 7005
would 7006
have 7007
been 7008
a 7009
wolf 7010
with 7011
you 7012
to 7013
my 7014
life’s 7015
end) 7016
that 7017
I 7018
feel 7019
your 7020
words 7021
are 7022
true. 7023
So 7024
I 7025
do 7026
not 7027
call 7028
ye 7029
my 7030
brothers 7031
any 7032
more, 7033
but 7034
sag 7035
[dogs], 7036
as 7037
a 7038
man 7039
should. 7040
What 7041
ye 7042
will 7043
do, 7044
and 7045
what 7046
ye 7047
will 7048
not 7049
do, 7050
is 7051
not 7052
yours 7053
to 7054
say. 7055
That 7056
matter 7057
is 7058
with 7059
me; 7060
and 7061
that 7062
we 7063
may 7064
see 7065
the 7066
matter 7067
more 7068
plainly, 7069
I, 7070
the 7071
man, 7072
have 7073
brought 7074
here 7075
a 7076
little 7077
of 7078
the 7079
Red 7080
Flower 7081
which 7082
ye, 7083
dogs, 7084
fear.” 7085
 7086
He 7087
flung 7088
the 7089
fire 7090
pot 7091
on 7092
the 7093
ground, 7094
and 7095
some 7096
of 7097
the 7098
red 7099
coals 7100
lit 7101
a 7102
tuft 7103
of 7104
dried 7105
moss 7106
that 7107
flared 7108
up, 7109
as 7110
all 7111
the 7112
Council 7113
drew 7114
back 7115
in 7116
terror 7117
before 7118
the 7119
leaping 7120
flames. 7121
 7122
Mowgli 7123
thrust 7124
his 7125
dead 7126
branch 7127
into 7128
the 7129
fire 7130
till 7131
the 7132
twigs 7133
lit 7134
and 7135
crackled, 7136
and 7137
whirled 7138
it 7139
above 7140
his 7141
head 7142
among 7143
the 7144
cowering 7145
wolves. 7146
 7147
“Thou 7148
art 7149
the 7150
master,” 7151
said 7152
Bagheera 7153
in 7154
an 7155
undertone. 7156
“Save 7157
Akela 7158
from 7159
the 7160
death. 7161
He 7162
was 7163
ever 7164
thy 7165
friend.” 7166
 7167
Akela, 7168
the 7169
grim 7170
old 7171
wolf 7172
who 7173
had 7174
never 7175
asked 7176
for 7177
mercy 7178
in 7179
his 7180
life, 7181
gave 7182
one 7183
piteous 7184
look 7185
at 7186
Mowgli 7187
as 7188
the 7189
boy 7190
stood 7191
all 7192
naked, 7193
his 7194
long 7195
black 7196
hair 7197
tossing 7198
over 7199
his 7200
shoulders 7201
in 7202
the 7203
light 7204
of 7205
the 7206
blazing 7207
branch 7208
that 7209
made 7210
the 7211
shadows 7212
jump 7213
and 7214
quiver. 7215
 7216
“Good!” 7217
said 7218
Mowgli, 7219
staring 7220
round 7221
slowly. 7222
“I 7223
see 7224
that 7225
ye 7226
are 7227
dogs. 7228
I 7229
go 7230
from 7231
you 7232
to 7233
my 7234
own 7235
people--if 7236
they 7237
be 7238
my 7239
own 7240
people. 7241
The 7242
jungle 7243
is 7244
shut 7245
to 7246
me, 7247
and 7248
I 7249
must 7250
forget 7251
your 7252
talk 7253
and 7254
your 7255
companionship. 7256
But 7257
I 7258
will 7259
be 7260
more 7261
merciful 7262
than 7263
ye 7264
are. 7265
Because 7266
I 7267
was 7268
all 7269
but 7270
your 7271
brother 7272
in 7273
blood, 7274
I 7275
promise 7276
that 7277
when 7278
I 7279
am 7280
a 7281
man 7282
among 7283
men 7284
I 7285
will 7286
not 7287
betray 7288
ye 7289
to 7290
men 7291
as 7292
ye 7293
have 7294
betrayed 7295
me.” 7296
He 7297
kicked 7298
the 7299
fire 7300
with 7301
his 7302
foot, 7303
and 7304
the 7305
sparks 7306
flew 7307
up. 7308
“There 7309
shall 7310
be 7311
no 7312
war 7313
between 7314
any 7315
of 7316
us 7317
in 7318
the 7319
Pack. 7320
But 7321
here 7322
is 7323
a 7324
debt 7325
to 7326
pay 7327
before 7328
I 7329
go.” 7330
He 7331
strode 7332
forward 7333
to 7334
where 7335
Shere 7336
Khan 7337
sat 7338
blinking 7339
stupidly 7340
at 7341
the 7342
flames, 7343
and 7344
caught 7345
him 7346
by 7347
the 7348
tuft 7349
on 7350
his 7351
chin. 7352
Bagheera 7353
followed 7354
in 7355
case 7356
of 7357
accidents. 7358
“Up, 7359
dog!” 7360
Mowgli 7361
cried. 7362
“Up, 7363
when 7364
a 7365
man 7366
speaks, 7367
or 7368
I 7369
will 7370
set 7371
that 7372
coat 7373
ablaze!” 7374
 7375
Shere 7376
Khan’s 7377
ears 7378
lay 7379
flat 7380
back 7381
on 7382
his 7383
head, 7384
and 7385
he 7386
shut 7387
his 7388
eyes, 7389
for 7390
the 7391
blazing 7392
branch 7393
was 7394
very 7395
near. 7396
 7397
“This 7398
cattle-killer 7399
said 7400
he 7401
would 7402
kill 7403
me 7404
in 7405
the 7406
Council 7407
because 7408
he 7409
had 7410
not 7411
killed 7412
me 7413
when 7414
I 7415
was 7416
a 7417
cub. 7418
Thus 7419
and 7420
thus, 7421
then, 7422
do 7423
we 7424
beat 7425
dogs 7426
when 7427
we 7428
are 7429
men. 7430
Stir 7431
a 7432
whisker, 7433
Lungri, 7434
and 7435
I 7436
ram 7437
the 7438
Red 7439
Flower 7440
down 7441
thy 7442
gullet!” 7443
He 7444
beat 7445
Shere 7446
Khan 7447
over 7448
the 7449
head 7450
with 7451
the 7452
branch, 7453
and 7454
the 7455
tiger 7456
whimpered 7457
and 7458
whined 7459
in 7460
an 7461
agony 7462
of 7463
fear. 7464
 7465
“Pah! 7466
Singed 7467
jungle 7468
cat--go 7469
now! 7470
But 7471
remember 7472
when 7473
next 7474
I 7475
come 7476
to 7477
the 7478
Council 7479
Rock, 7480
as 7481
a 7482
man 7483
should 7484
come, 7485
it 7486
will 7487
be 7488
with 7489
Shere 7490
Khan’s 7491
hide 7492
on 7493
my 7494
head. 7495
For 7496
the 7497
rest, 7498
Akela 7499
goes 7500
free 7501
to 7502
live 7503
as 7504
he 7505
pleases. 7506
Ye 7507
will 7508
not 7509
kill 7510
him, 7511
because 7512
that 7513
is 7514
not 7515
my 7516
will. 7517
Nor 7518
do 7519
I 7520
think 7521
that 7522
ye 7523
will 7524
sit 7525
here 7526
any 7527
longer, 7528
lolling 7529
out 7530
your 7531
tongues 7532
as 7533
though 7534
ye 7535
were 7536
somebodies, 7537
instead 7538
of 7539
dogs 7540
whom 7541
I 7542
drive 7543
out--thus! 7544
Go!” 7545
The 7546
fire 7547
was 7548
burning 7549
furiously 7550
at 7551
the 7552
end 7553
of 7554
the 7555
branch, 7556
and 7557
Mowgli 7558
struck 7559
right 7560
and 7561
left 7562
round 7563
the 7564
circle, 7565
and 7566
the 7567
wolves 7568
ran 7569
howling 7570
with 7571
the 7572
sparks 7573
burning 7574
their 7575
fur. 7576
At 7577
last 7578
there 7579
were 7580
only 7581
Akela, 7582
Bagheera, 7583
and 7584
perhaps 7585
ten 7586
wolves 7587
that 7588
had 7589
taken 7590
Mowgli’s 7591
part. 7592
Then 7593
something 7594
began 7595
to 7596
hurt 7597
Mowgli 7598
inside 7599
him, 7600
as 7601
he 7602
had 7603
never 7604
been 7605
hurt 7606
in 7607
his 7608
life 7609
before, 7610
and 7611
he 7612
caught 7613
his 7614
breath 7615
and 7616
sobbed, 7617
and 7618
the 7619
tears 7620
ran 7621
down 7622
his 7623
face. 7624
 7625
“What 7626
is 7627
it? 7628
What 7629
is 7630
it?” 7631
he 7632
said. 7633
“I 7634
do 7635
not 7636
wish 7637
to 7638
leave 7639
the 7640
jungle, 7641
and 7642
I 7643
do 7644
not 7645
know 7646
what 7647
this 7648
is. 7649
Am 7650
I 7651
dying, 7652
Bagheera?” 7653
 7654
“No, 7655
Little 7656
Brother. 7657
That 7658
is 7659
only 7660
tears 7661
such 7662
as 7663
men 7664
use,” 7665
said 7666
Bagheera. 7667
“Now 7668
I 7669
know 7670
thou 7671
art 7672
a 7673
man, 7674
and 7675
a 7676
man’s 7677
cub 7678
no 7679
longer. 7680
The 7681
jungle 7682
is 7683
shut 7684
indeed 7685
to 7686
thee 7687
henceforward. 7688
Let 7689
them 7690
fall, 7691
Mowgli. 7692
They 7693
are 7694
only 7695
tears.” 7696
So 7697
Mowgli 7698
sat 7699
and 7700
cried 7701
as 7702
though 7703
his 7704
heart 7705
would 7706
break; 7707
and 7708
he 7709
had 7710
never 7711
cried 7712
in 7713
all 7714
his 7715
life 7716
before. 7717
 7718
“Now,” 7719
he 7720
said, 7721
“I 7722
will 7723
go 7724
to 7725
men. 7726
But 7727
first 7728
I 7729
must 7730
say 7731
farewell 7732
to 7733
my 7734
mother.” 7735
And 7736
he 7737
went 7738
to 7739
the 7740
cave 7741
where 7742
she 7743
lived 7744
with 7745
Father 7746
Wolf, 7747
and 7748
he 7749
cried 7750
on 7751
her 7752
coat, 7753
while 7754
the 7755
four 7756
cubs 7757
howled 7758
miserably. 7759
 7760
“Ye 7761
will 7762
not 7763
forget 7764
me?” 7765
said 7766
Mowgli. 7767
 7768
“Never 7769
while 7770
we 7771
can 7772
follow 7773
a 7774
trail,” 7775
said 7776
the 7777
cubs. 7778
“Come 7779
to 7780
the 7781
foot 7782
of 7783
the 7784
hill 7785
when 7786
thou 7787
art 7788
a 7789
man, 7790
and 7791
we 7792
will 7793
talk 7794
to 7795
thee; 7796
and 7797
we 7798
will 7799
come 7800
into 7801
the 7802
croplands 7803
to 7804
play 7805
with 7806
thee 7807
by 7808
night.” 7809
 7810
“Come 7811
soon!” 7812
said 7813
Father 7814
Wolf. 7815
“Oh, 7816
wise 7817
little 7818
frog, 7819
come 7820
again 7821
soon; 7822
for 7823
we 7824
be 7825
old, 7826
thy 7827
mother 7828
and 7829
I.” 7830
 7831
“Come 7832
soon,” 7833
said 7834
Mother 7835
Wolf, 7836
“little 7837
naked 7838
son 7839
of 7840
mine. 7841
For, 7842
listen, 7843
child 7844
of 7845
man, 7846
I 7847
loved 7848
thee 7849
more 7850
than 7851
ever 7852
I 7853
loved 7854
my 7855
cubs.” 7856
 7857
“I 7858
will 7859
surely 7860
come,” 7861
said 7862
Mowgli. 7863
“And 7864
when 7865
I 7866
come 7867
it 7868
will 7869
be 7870
to 7871
lay 7872
out 7873
Shere 7874
Khan’s 7875
hide 7876
upon 7877
the 7878
Council 7879
Rock. 7880
Do 7881
not 7882
forget 7883
me! 7884
Tell 7885
them 7886
in 7887
the 7888
jungle 7889
never 7890
to 7891
forget 7892
me!” 7893
 7894
The 7895
dawn 7896
was 7897
beginning 7898
to 7899
break 7900
when 7901
Mowgli 7902
went 7903
down 7904
the 7905
hillside 7906
alone, 7907
to 7908
meet 7909
those 7910
mysterious 7911
things 7912
that 7913
are 7914
called 7915
men. 7916
 7917
 7918
 7919
 7920
Hunting-Song 7921
of 7922
the 7923
Seeonee 7924
Pack 7925
 7926
 7927
 7928
 7929
 7930
 7931
As 7932
the 7933
dawn 7934
was 7935
breaking 7936
the 7937
Sambhur 7938
belled 7939
 7940
 7941
 7942
 7943
 7944
 7945
 7946
 7947
Once, 7948
twice 7949
and 7950
again! 7951
 7952
 7953
 7954
 7955
 7956
And 7957
a 7958
doe 7959
leaped 7960
up, 7961
and 7962
a 7963
doe 7964
leaped 7965
up 7966
 7967
 7968
 7969
 7970
 7971
From 7972
the 7973
pond 7974
in 7975
the 7976
wood 7977
where 7978
the 7979
wild 7980
deer 7981
sup. 7982
 7983
 7984
 7985
 7986
 7987
This 7988
I, 7989
scouting 7990
alone, 7991
beheld, 7992
 7993
 7994
 7995
 7996
 7997
 7998
 7999
 8000
Once, 8001
twice 8002
and 8003
again! 8004
 8005
 8006
 8007
 8008
 8009
 8010
As 8011
the 8012

 8031
 8032
 8033
 8034
 8035
And 8036
a 8037
wolf 8038
stole 8039
back, 8040
and 8041
a 8042
wolf 8043
stole 8044
back 8045
 8046
 8047
 8048
 8049
 8050
To 8051
carry 8052
the 8053
word 8054
to 8055
the 8056
waiting 8057
pack, 8058
 8059
 8060
 8061
 8062
 8063
And 8064
we 8065
sought 8066
and 8067
we 8068
found 8069
and 8070
we 8071
bayed 8072
on 8073
his 8074
track 8075
 8076
 8077
 8078
 8079
 8080
 8081
 8082
 8083
Once, 8084

again! 8087
 8088
 8089
 8090
 8091
 8092
 8093
As 8094

Ye 8221

not 8223
stop 8224

to 8226
inform 8227
us: 8228
we 8229
knew 8230
it 8231
ten 8232

before. 8234
 8235
Oppress 8236
not 8237
the 8238
cubs 8239
of 8240
the 8241
stranger, 8242
but 8243
hail 8244
them 8245
as 8246
Sister 8247
and 8248
Brother, 8249
For 8250
though 8251
they 8252
are 8253
little 8254
and 8255
fubsy, 8256
it 8257
may 8258
be 8259
the 8260
Bear 8261
is 8262
their 8263
mother. 8264
“There 8265
is 8266
none 8267
like 8268
to 8269
me!” 8270
says 8271
the 8272
Cub 8273
in 8274
the 8275
pride 8276
of 8277
his 8278
earliest 8279

But 8281
the 8282

is 8284
large 8285
and 8286
the 8287
Cub 8288
he 8289
is 8290
small. 8291
Let 8292
him 8293
think 8294
and 8295
be 8296
still. 8297

_Maxims 8331

Baloo_ 8333
 8334
All 8335
that 8336
is 8337
told 8338
here 8339
happened 8340
some 8341
time 8342
before 8343
Mowgli 8344
was 8345
turned 8346
out 8347
of 8348
the 8349
Seeonee 8350
Wolf 8351
Pack, 8352
or 8353
revenged 8354
himself 8355
on 8356
Shere 8357
Khan 8358
the 8359
tiger. 8360
It 8361
was 8362
in 8363
the 8364
days 8365
when 8366
Baloo 8367
was 8368
teaching 8369
him 8370
the 8371
Law 8372
of 8373
the 8374
Jungle. 8375
The 8376
big, 8377
serious, 8378
old 8379
brown 8380
bear 8381
was 8382
delighted 8383
to 8384
have 8385
so 8386
quick 8387
a 8388
pupil, 8389
for 8390
the 8391
young 8392
wolves 8393
will 8394
only 8395
learn 8396
as 8397
much 8398
of 8399
the 8400
Law 8401
of 8402
the 8403
Jungle 8404
as 8405
applies 8406
to 8407
their 8408
own 8409
pack 8410
and 8411
tribe, 8412
and 8413
run 8414
away 8415
as 8416
soon 8417
as 8418
they 8419
can 8420
repeat 8421
the 8422
Hunting 8423
Verse--“Feet 8424
that 8425
make 8426
no 8427
noise; 8428
eyes 8429
that 8430
can 8431
see 8432
in 8433
the 8434
dark; 8435
ears 8436
that 8437
can 8438
hear 8439
the 8440
winds 8441
in 8442
their 8443
lairs, 8444
and 8445
sharp 8446
white 8447
teeth, 8448
all 8449
these 8450
things 8451
are 8452
the 8453
marks 8454
of 8455
our 8456
brothers 8457
except 8458
Tabaqui 8459
the 8460
Jackal 8461
and 8462
the 8463
Hyaena 8464
whom 8465
we 8466
hate.” 8467
But 8468
Mowgli, 8469
as 8470
a 8471
man-cub, 8472
had 8473
to 8474
learn 8475
a 8476
great 8477
deal 8478
more 8479
than 8480
this. 8481
Sometimes 8482
Bagheera 8483
the 8484
Black 8485
Panther 8486
would 8487
come 8488
lounging 8489
through 8490
the 8491
jungle 8492
to 8493
see 8494
how 8495
his 8496
pet 8497
was 8498
getting 8499
on, 8500
and 8501
would 8502
purr 8503
with 8504
his 8505
head 8506
against 8507
a 8508
tree 8509
while 8510
Mowgli 8511
recited 8512
the 8513
day’s 8514
lesson 8515
to 8516
Baloo. 8517
The 8518
boy 8519
could 8520
climb 8521
almost 8522
as 8523
well 8524
as 8525
he 8526
could 8527
swim, 8528
and 8529
swim 8530
almost 8531
as 8532
well 8533
as 8534
he 8535
could 8536
run. 8537
So 8538
Baloo, 8539
the 8540
Teacher 8541
of 8542
the 8543
Law, 8544
taught 8545
him 8546
the 8547
Wood 8548
and 8549
Water 8550
Laws: 8551
how 8552
to 8553
tell 8554
a 8555
rotten 8556
branch 8557
from 8558
a 8559
sound 8560
one; 8561
how 8562
to 8563
speak 8564
politely 8565
to 8566
the 8567
wild 8568
bees 8569
when 8570
he 8571
came 8572
upon 8573
a 8574
hive 8575
of 8576
them 8577
fifty 8578
feet 8579
above 8580
ground; 8581
what 8582
to 8583
say 8584
to 8585
Mang 8586
the 8587
Bat 8588
when 8589
he 8590
disturbed 8591
him 8592
in 8593
the 8594
branches 8595
at 8596
midday; 8597
and 8598
how 8599
to 8600
warn 8601
the 8602
water-snakes 8603
in 8604
the 8605
pools 8606
before 8607
he 8608
splashed 8609
down 8610
among 8611
them. 8612
None 8613
of 8614
the 8615
Jungle 8616
People 8617
like 8618
being 8619
disturbed, 8620
and 8621
all 8622
are 8623
very 8624
ready 8625
to 8626
fly 8627
at 8628
an 8629
intruder. 8630
Then, 8631
too, 8632
Mowgli 8633
was 8634
taught 8635
the 8636
Strangers’ 8637
Hunting 8638
Call, 8639
which 8640
must 8641
be 8642
repeated 8643
aloud 8644
till 8645
it 8646
is 8647
answered, 8648
whenever 8649
one 8650
of 8651
the 8652
Jungle-People 8653
hunts 8654
outside 8655
his 8656
own 8657
grounds. 8658
It 8659
means, 8660
translated, 8661
“Give 8662
me 8663
leave 8664
to 8665
hunt 8666
here 8667
because 8668
I 8669
am 8670
hungry.” 8671
And 8672
the 8673
answer 8674
is, 8675
“Hunt 8676
then 8677
for 8678
food, 8679
but 8680
not 8681
for 8682
pleasure.” 8683
 8684
All 8685
this 8686
will 8687
show 8688
you 8689
how 8690
much 8691
Mowgli 8692
had 8693
to 8694
learn 8695
by 8696
heart, 8697
and 8698
he 8699
grew 8700
very 8701
tired 8702
of 8703
saying 8704
the 8705
same 8706
thing 8707
over 8708
a 8709
hundred 8710
times. 8711
But, 8712
as 8713
Baloo 8714
said 8715
to 8716
Bagheera, 8717
one 8718
day 8719
when 8720
Mowgli 8721
had 8722
been 8723
cuffed 8724
and 8725
run 8726
off 8727
in 8728
a 8729
temper, 8730
“A 8731
man’s 8732
cub 8733
is 8734
a 8735
man’s 8736
cub, 8737
and 8738
he 8739
must 8740
learn 8741
all 8742
the 8743
Law 8744
of 8745
the 8746
Jungle.” 8747
 8748
“But 8749
think 8750
how 8751
small 8752
he 8753
is,” 8754
said 8755
the 8756
Black 8757
Panther, 8758
who 8759
would 8760
have 8761
spoiled 8762
Mowgli 8763
if 8764
he 8765
had 8766
had 8767
his 8768
own 8769
way. 8770
“How 8771
can 8772
his 8773
little 8774
head 8775
carry 8776
all 8777
thy 8778
long 8779
talk?” 8780
 8781
“Is 8782
there 8783
anything 8784
in 8785
the 8786
jungle 8787
too 8788
little 8789
to 8790
be 8791
killed? 8792
No. 8793
That 8794
is 8795
why 8796
I 8797
teach 8798
him 8799
these 8800
things, 8801
and 8802
that 8803
is 8804
why 8805
I 8806
hit 8807
him, 8808
very 8809
softly, 8810
when 8811
he 8812
forgets.” 8813
 8814
“Softly! 8815
What 8816
dost 8817
thou 8818
know 8819
of 8820
softness, 8821
old 8822
Iron-feet?” 8823
Bagheera 8824
grunted. 8825
“His 8826
face 8827
is 8828
all 8829
bruised 8830
today 8831
by 8832
thy--softness. 8833
Ugh.” 8834
 8835
“Better 8836
he 8837
should 8838
be 8839
bruised 8840
from 8841
head 8842
to 8843
foot 8844
by 8845
me 8846
who 8847
love 8848
him 8849
than 8850
that 8851
he 8852
should 8853
come 8854
to 8855
harm 8856
through 8857
ignorance,” 8858
Baloo 8859
answered 8860
very 8861
earnestly. 8862
“I 8863
am 8864
now 8865
teaching 8866
him 8867
the 8868
Master 8869
Words 8870
of 8871
the 8872
Jungle 8873
that 8874
shall 8875
protect 8876
him 8877
with 8878
the 8879
birds 8880
and 8881
the 8882
Snake 8883
People, 8884
and 8885
all 8886
that 8887
hunt 8888
on 8889
four 8890
feet, 8891
except 8892
his 8893
own 8894
pack. 8895
He 8896
can 8897
now 8898
claim 8899
protection, 8900
if 8901
he 8902
will 8903
only 8904
remember 8905
the 8906
words, 8907
from 8908
all 8909
in 8910
the 8911
jungle. 8912
Is 8913
not 8914
that 8915
worth 8916
a 8917
little 8918
beating?” 8919
 8920
“Well, 8921
look 8922
to 8923
it 8924
then 8925
that 8926
thou 8927
dost 8928
not 8929
kill 8930
the 8931
man-cub. 8932
He 8933
is 8934
no 8935
tree 8936
trunk 8937
to 8938
sharpen 8939
thy 8940
blunt 8941
claws 8942
upon. 8943
But 8944
what 8945
are 8946
those 8947
Master 8948
Words? 8949
I 8950
am 8951
more 8952
likely 8953
to 8954
give 8955
help 8956
than 8957
to 8958
ask 8959
it”--Bagheera 8960
stretched 8961
out 8962
one 8963
paw 8964
and 8965
admired 8966
the 8967
steel-blue, 8968
ripping-chisel 8969
talons 8970
at 8971
the 8972
end 8973
of 8974
it--“still 8975
I 8976
should 8977
like 8978
to 8979
know.” 8980
 8981
“I 8982
will 8983
call 8984
Mowgli 8985
and 8986
he 8987
shall 8988
say 8989
them--if 8990
he 8991
will. 8992
Come, 8993
Little 8994
Brother!” 8995
 8996
“My 8997
head 8998
is 8999
ringing 9000
like 9001
a 9002
bee 9003
tree,” 9004
said 9005
a 9006
sullen 9007
little 9008
voice 9009
over 9010
their 9011
heads, 9012
and 9013
Mowgli 9014
slid 9015
down 9016
a 9017
tree 9018
trunk 9019
very 9020
angry 9021
and 9022
indignant, 9023
adding 9024
as 9025
he 9026
reached 9027
the 9028
ground: 9029
“I 9030
come 9031
for 9032
Bagheera 9033
and 9034
not 9035
for 9036
thee, 9037
fat 9038
old 9039
Baloo!” 9040
 9041
“That 9042
is 9043
all 9044
one 9045
to 9046
me,” 9047
said 9048
Baloo, 9049
though 9050
he 9051
was 9052
hurt 9053
and 9054
grieved. 9055
“Tell 9056
Bagheera, 9057
then, 9058
the 9059
Master 9060
Words 9061
of 9062
the 9063
Jungle 9064
that 9065
I 9066
have 9067
taught 9068
thee 9069
this 9070
day.” 9071
 9072
“Master 9073
Words 9074
for 9075
which 9076
people?” 9077
said 9078
Mowgli, 9079
delighted 9080
to 9081
show 9082
off. 9083
“The 9084
jungle 9085
has 9086
many 9087
tongues. 9088
I 9089
know 9090
them 9091
all.” 9092
 9093
“A 9094
little 9095
thou 9096
knowest, 9097
but 9098
not 9099
much. 9100
See, 9101
O 9102
Bagheera, 9103
they 9104
never 9105
thank 9106
their 9107
teacher. 9108
Not 9109
one 9110
small 9111
wolfling 9112
has 9113
ever 9114
come 9115
back 9116
to 9117
thank 9118
old 9119
Baloo 9120
for 9121
his 9122
teachings. 9123
Say 9124
the 9125
word 9126
for 9127
the 9128
Hunting-People, 9129
then--great 9130
scholar.” 9131
 9132
“We 9133
be 9134
of 9135
one 9136
blood, 9137
ye 9138
and 9139
I,” 9140
said 9141
Mowgli, 9142
giving 9143
the 9144
words 9145
the 9146
Bear 9147
accent 9148
which 9149
all 9150
the 9151
Hunting 9152
People 9153
use. 9154
 9155
“Good. 9156
Now 9157
for 9158
the 9159
birds.” 9160
 9161
Mowgli 9162
repeated, 9163
with 9164
the 9165
Kite’s 9166
whistle 9167
at 9168
the 9169
end 9170
of 9171
the 9172
sentence. 9173
 9174
“Now 9175
for 9176
the 9177
Snake-People,” 9178
said 9179
Bagheera. 9180
 9181
The 9182
answer 9183
was 9184
a 9185
perfectly 9186
indescribable 9187
hiss, 9188
and 9189
Mowgli 9190
kicked 9191
up 9192
his 9193
feet 9194
behind, 9195
clapped 9196
his 9197
hands 9198
together 9199
to 9200
applaud 9201
himself, 9202
and 9203
jumped 9204
on 9205
to 9206
Bagheera’s 9207
back, 9208
where 9209
he 9210
sat 9211
sideways, 9212
drumming 9213
with 9214
his 9215
heels 9216
on 9217
the 9218
glossy 9219
skin 9220
and 9221
making 9222
the 9223
worst 9224
faces 9225
he 9226
could 9227
think 9228
of 9229
at 9230
Baloo. 9231
 9232
“There--there! 9233
That 9234
was 9235
worth 9236
a 9237
little 9238
bruise,” 9239
said 9240
the 9241
brown 9242
bear 9243
tenderly. 9244
“Some 9245
day 9246
thou 9247
wilt 9248
remember 9249
me.” 9250
Then 9251
he 9252
turned 9253
aside 9254
to 9255
tell 9256
Bagheera 9257
how 9258
he 9259
had 9260
begged 9261
the 9262
Master 9263
Words 9264
from 9265
Hathi 9266
the 9267
Wild 9268
Elephant, 9269
who 9270
knows 9271
all 9272
about 9273
these 9274
things, 9275
and 9276
how 9277
Hathi 9278
had 9279
taken 9280
Mowgli 9281
down 9282
to 9283
a 9284
pool 9285
to 9286
get 9287
the 9288
Snake 9289
Word 9290
from 9291
a 9292
water-snake, 9293
because 9294
Baloo 9295
could 9296
not 9297
pronounce 9298
it, 9299
and 9300
how 9301
Mowgli 9302
was 9303
now 9304
reasonably 9305
safe 9306
against 9307
all 9308
accidents 9309
in 9310
the 9311
jungle, 9312
because 9313
neither 9314
snake, 9315
bird, 9316
nor 9317
beast 9318
would 9319
hurt 9320
him. 9321
 9322
“No 9323
one 9324
then 9325
is 9326
to 9327
be 9328
feared,” 9329
Baloo 9330
wound 9331
up, 9332
patting 9333
his 9334
big 9335
furry 9336
stomach 9337
with 9338
pride. 9339
 9340
“Except 9341
his 9342
own 9343
tribe,” 9344
said 9345
Bagheera, 9346
under 9347
his 9348
breath; 9349
and 9350
then 9351
aloud 9352
to 9353
Mowgli, 9354
“Have 9355
a 9356
care 9357
for 9358
my 9359
ribs, 9360
Little 9361
Brother! 9362
What 9363
is 9364
all 9365
this 9366
dancing 9367
up 9368
and 9369
down?” 9370
 9371
Mowgli 9372
had 9373
been 9374
trying 9375
to 9376
make 9377
himself 9378
heard 9379
by 9380
pulling 9381
at 9382
Bagheera’s 9383
shoulder 9384
fur 9385
and 9386
kicking 9387
hard. 9388
When 9389
the 9390
two 9391
listened 9392
to 9393
him 9394
he 9395
was 9396
shouting 9397
at 9398
the 9399
top 9400
of 9401
his 9402
voice, 9403
“And 9404
so 9405
I 9406
shall 9407
have 9408
a 9409
tribe 9410
of 9411
my 9412
own, 9413
and 9414
lead 9415
them 9416
through 9417
the 9418
branches 9419
all 9420
day 9421
long.” 9422
 9423
“What 9424
is 9425
this 9426
new 9427
folly, 9428
little 9429
dreamer 9430
of 9431
dreams?” 9432
said 9433
Bagheera. 9434
 9435
“Yes, 9436
and 9437
throw 9438
branches 9439
and 9440
dirt 9441
at 9442
old 9443
Baloo,” 9444
Mowgli 9445
went 9446
on. 9447
“They 9448
have 9449
promised 9450
me 9451
this. 9452
Ah!” 9453
 9454
“Whoof!” 9455
Baloo’s 9456
big 9457
paw 9458
scooped 9459
Mowgli 9460
off 9461
Bagheera’s 9462
back, 9463
and 9464
as 9465
the 9466
boy 9467
lay 9468
between 9469
the 9470
big 9471
fore-paws 9472
he 9473
could 9474
see 9475
the 9476
Bear 9477
was 9478
angry. 9479
 9480
“Mowgli,” 9481
said 9482
Baloo, 9483
“thou 9484
hast 9485
been 9486
talking 9487
with 9488
the 9489
Bandar-log--the 9490
Monkey 9491
People.” 9492
 9493
Mowgli 9494
looked 9495
at 9496
Bagheera 9497
to 9498
see 9499
if 9500
the 9501
Panther 9502
was 9503
angry 9504
too, 9505
and 9506
Bagheera’s 9507
eyes 9508
were 9509
as 9510
hard 9511
as 9512
jade 9513
stones. 9514
 9515
“Thou 9516
hast 9517
been 9518
with 9519
the 9520
Monkey 9521
People--the 9522
gray 9523
apes--the 9524
people 9525
without 9526
a 9527
law--the 9528
eaters 9529
of 9530
everything. 9531
That 9532
is 9533
great 9534
shame.” 9535
 9536
“When 9537
Baloo 9538
hurt 9539
my 9540
head,” 9541
said 9542
Mowgli 9543
(he 9544
was 9545
still 9546
on 9547
his 9548
back), 9549
“I 9550
went 9551
away, 9552
and 9553
the 9554
gray 9555
apes 9556
came 9557
down 9558
from 9559
the 9560
trees 9561
and 9562
had 9563
pity 9564
on 9565
me. 9566
No 9567
one 9568
else 9569
cared.” 9570
He 9571
snuffled 9572
a 9573
little. 9574
 9575
“The 9576
pity 9577
of 9578
the 9579
Monkey 9580
People!” 9581
Baloo 9582
snorted. 9583
“The 9584
stillness 9585
of 9586
the 9587
mountain 9588
stream! 9589
The 9590
cool 9591
of 9592
the 9593
summer 9594
sun! 9595
And 9596
then, 9597
man-cub?” 9598
 9599
“And 9600
then, 9601
and 9602
then, 9603
they 9604
gave 9605
me 9606
nuts 9607
and 9608
pleasant 9609
things 9610
to 9611
eat, 9612
and 9613
they--they 9614
carried 9615
me 9616
in 9617
their 9618
arms 9619
up 9620
to 9621
the 9622
top 9623
of 9624
the 9625
trees 9626
and 9627
said 9628
I 9629
was 9630
their 9631
blood 9632
brother 9633
except 9634
that 9635
I 9636
had 9637
no 9638
tail, 9639
and 9640
should 9641
be 9642
their 9643
leader 9644
some 9645
day.” 9646
 9647
“They 9648
have 9649
no 9650
leader,” 9651
said 9652
Bagheera. 9653
“They 9654
lie. 9655
They 9656
have 9657
always 9658
lied.” 9659
 9660
“They 9661
were 9662
very 9663
kind 9664
and 9665
bade 9666
me 9667
come 9668
again. 9669
Why 9670
have 9671
I 9672
never 9673
been 9674
taken 9675
among 9676
the 9677
Monkey 9678
People? 9679
They 9680
stand 9681
on 9682
their 9683
feet 9684
as 9685
I 9686
do. 9687
They 9688
do 9689
not 9690
hit 9691
me 9692
with 9693
their 9694
hard 9695
paws. 9696
They 9697
play 9698
all 9699
day. 9700
Let 9701
me 9702
get 9703
up! 9704
Bad 9705
Baloo, 9706
let 9707
me 9708
up! 9709
I 9710
will 9711
play 9712
with 9713
them 9714
again.” 9715
 9716
“Listen, 9717
man-cub,” 9718
said 9719
the 9720
Bear, 9721
and 9722
his 9723
voice 9724
rumbled 9725
like 9726
thunder 9727
on 9728
a 9729
hot 9730
night. 9731
“I 9732
have 9733
taught 9734
thee 9735
all 9736
the 9737
Law 9738
of 9739
the 9740
Jungle 9741
for 9742
all 9743
the 9744
peoples 9745
of 9746
the 9747
jungle--except 9748
the 9749
Monkey-Folk 9750
who 9751
live 9752
in 9753
the 9754
trees. 9755
They 9756
have 9757
no 9758
law. 9759
They 9760
are 9761
outcasts. 9762
They 9763
have 9764
no 9765
speech 9766
of 9767
their 9768
own, 9769
but 9770
use 9771
the 9772
stolen 9773
words 9774
which 9775
they 9776
overhear 9777
when 9778
they 9779
listen, 9780
and 9781
peep, 9782
and 9783
wait 9784
up 9785
above 9786
in 9787
the 9788
branches. 9789
Their 9790
way 9791
is 9792
not 9793
our 9794
way. 9795
They 9796
are 9797
without 9798
leaders. 9799
They 9800
have 9801
no 9802
remembrance. 9803
They 9804
boast 9805
and 9806
chatter 9807
and 9808
pretend 9809
that 9810
they 9811
are 9812
a 9813
great 9814
people 9815
about 9816
to 9817
do 9818
great 9819
affairs 9820
in 9821
the 9822
jungle, 9823
but 9824
the 9825
falling 9826
of 9827
a 9828
nut 9829
turns 9830
their 9831
minds 9832
to 9833
laughter 9834
and 9835
all 9836
is 9837
forgotten. 9838
We 9839
of 9840
the 9841
jungle 9842
have 9843
no 9844
dealings 9845
with 9846
them. 9847
We 9848
do 9849
not 9850
drink 9851
where 9852
the 9853
monkeys 9854
drink; 9855
we 9856
do 9857
not 9858
go 9859
where 9860
the 9861
monkeys 9862
go; 9863
we 9864
do 9865
not 9866
hunt 9867
where 9868
they 9869
hunt; 9870
we 9871
do 9872
not 9873
die 9874
where 9875
they 9876
die. 9877
Hast 9878
thou 9879
ever 9880
heard 9881
me 9882
speak 9883
of 9884
the 9885
Bandar-log 9886
till 9887
today?” 9888
 9889
“No,” 9890
said 9891
Mowgli 9892
in 9893
a 9894
whisper, 9895
for 9896
the 9897
forest 9898
was 9899
very 9900
still 9901
now 9902
Baloo 9903
had 9904
finished. 9905
 9906
“The 9907
Jungle-People 9908
put 9909
them 9910
out 9911
of 9912
their 9913
mouths 9914
and 9915
out 9916
of 9917
their 9918
minds. 9919
They 9920
are 9921
very 9922
many, 9923
evil, 9924
dirty, 9925
shameless, 9926
and 9927
they 9928
desire, 9929
if 9930
they 9931
have 9932
any 9933
fixed 9934
desire, 9935
to 9936
be 9937
noticed 9938
by 9939
the 9940
Jungle 9941
People. 9942
But 9943
we 9944
do 9945
not 9946
notice 9947
them 9948
even 9949
when 9950
they 9951
throw 9952
nuts 9953
and 9954
filth 9955
on 9956
our 9957
heads.” 9958
 9959
He 9960
had 9961
hardly 9962
spoken 9963
when 9964
a 9965
shower 9966
of 9967
nuts 9968
and 9969
twigs 9970
spattered 9971
down 9972
through 9973
the 9974
branches; 9975
and 9976
they 9977
could 9978
hear 9979
coughings 9980
and 9981
howlings 9982
and 9983
angry 9984
jumpings 9985
high 9986
up 9987
in 9988
the 9989
air 9990
among 9991
the 9992
thin 9993
branches. 9994
 9995
“The 9996
Monkey-People 9997
are 9998
forbidden,” 9999
said 10000
Baloo, 10001
“forbidden 10002
to 10003
the 10004
Jungle-People. 10005
Remember.” 10006
 10007
“Forbidden,” 10008
said 10009
Bagheera, 10010
“but 10011
I 10012
still 10013
think 10014
Baloo 10015
should 10016
have 10017
warned 10018
thee 10019
against 10020
them.” 10021
 10022
“I--I? 10023
How 10024
was 10025
I 10026
to 10027
guess 10028
he 10029
would 10030
play 10031
with 10032
such 10033
dirt. 10034
The 10035
Monkey 10036
People! 10037
Faugh!” 10038
 10039
A 10040
fresh 10041
shower 10042
came 10043
down 10044
on 10045
their 10046
heads 10047
and 10048
the 10049
two 10050
trotted 10051
away, 10052
taking 10053
Mowgli 10054
with 10055
them. 10056
What 10057
Baloo 10058
had 10059
said 10060
about 10061
the 10062
monkeys 10063
was 10064
perfectly 10065
true. 10066
They 10067
belonged 10068
to 10069
the 10070
tree-tops, 10071
and 10072
as 10073
beasts 10074
very 10075
seldom 10076
look 10077
up, 10078
there 10079
was 10080
no 10081
occasion 10082
for 10083
the 10084
monkeys 10085
and 10086
the 10087
Jungle-People 10088
to 10089
cross 10090
each 10091
other’s 10092
path. 10093
But 10094
whenever 10095
they 10096
found 10097
a 10098
sick 10099
wolf, 10100
or 10101
a 10102
wounded 10103
tiger, 10104
or 10105
bear, 10106
the 10107
monkeys 10108
would 10109
torment 10110
him, 10111
and 10112
would 10113
throw 10114
sticks 10115
and 10116
nuts 10117
at 10118
any 10119
beast 10120
for 10121
fun 10122
and 10123
in 10124
the 10125
hope 10126
of 10127
being 10128
noticed. 10129
Then 10130
they 10131
would 10132
howl 10133
and 10134
shriek 10135
senseless 10136
songs, 10137
and 10138
invite 10139
the 10140
Jungle-People 10141
to 10142
climb 10143
up 10144
their 10145
trees 10146
and 10147
fight 10148
them, 10149
or 10150
would 10151
start 10152
furious 10153
battles 10154
over 10155
nothing 10156
among 10157
themselves, 10158
and 10159
leave 10160
the 10161
dead 10162
monkeys 10163
where 10164
the 10165
Jungle-People 10166
could 10167
see 10168
them. 10169
They 10170
were 10171
always 10172
just 10173
going 10174
to 10175
have 10176
a 10177
leader, 10178
and 10179
laws 10180
and 10181
customs 10182
of 10183
their 10184
own, 10185
but 10186
they 10187
never 10188
did, 10189
because 10190
their 10191
memories 10192
would 10193
not 10194
hold 10195
over 10196
from 10197
day 10198
to 10199
day, 10200
and 10201
so 10202
they 10203
compromised 10204
things 10205
by 10206
making 10207
up 10208
a 10209
saying, 10210
“What 10211
the 10212
Bandar-log 10213
think 10214
now 10215
the 10216
jungle 10217
will 10218
think 10219
later,” 10220
and 10221
that 10222
comforted 10223
them 10224
a 10225
great 10226
deal. 10227
None 10228
of 10229
the 10230
beasts 10231
could 10232
reach 10233
them, 10234
but 10235
on 10236
the 10237
other 10238
hand 10239
none 10240
of 10241
the 10242
beasts 10243
would 10244
notice 10245
them, 10246
and 10247
that 10248
was 10249
why 10250
they 10251
were 10252
so 10253
pleased 10254
when 10255
Mowgli 10256
came 10257
to 10258
play 10259
with 10260
them, 10261
and 10262
they 10263
heard 10264
how 10265
angry 10266
Baloo 10267
was. 10268
 10269
They 10270
never 10271
meant 10272
to 10273
do 10274
any 10275
more--the 10276
Bandar-log 10277
never 10278
mean 10279
anything 10280
at 10281
all; 10282
but 10283
one 10284
of 10285
them 10286
invented 10287
what 10288
seemed 10289
to 10290
him 10291
a 10292
brilliant 10293
idea, 10294
and 10295
he 10296
told 10297
all 10298
the 10299
others 10300
that 10301
Mowgli 10302
would 10303
be 10304
a 10305
useful 10306
person 10307
to 10308
keep 10309
in 10310
the 10311
tribe, 10312
because 10313
he 10314
could 10315
weave 10316
sticks 10317
together 10318
for 10319
protection 10320
from 10321
the 10322
wind; 10323
so, 10324
if 10325
they 10326
caught 10327
him, 10328
they 10329
could 10330
make 10331
him 10332
teach 10333
them. 10334
Of 10335
course 10336
Mowgli, 10337
as 10338
a 10339
woodcutter’s 10340
child, 10341
inherited 10342
all 10343
sorts 10344
of 10345
instincts, 10346
and 10347
used 10348
to 10349
make 10350
little 10351
huts 10352
of 10353
fallen 10354
branches 10355
without 10356
thinking 10357
how 10358
he 10359
came 10360
to 10361
do 10362
it. 10363
The 10364
Monkey-People, 10365
watching 10366
in 10367
the 10368
trees, 10369
considered 10370
his 10371
play 10372
most 10373
wonderful. 10374
This 10375
time, 10376
they 10377
said, 10378
they 10379
were 10380
really 10381
going 10382
to 10383
have 10384
a 10385
leader 10386
and 10387
become 10388
the 10389
wisest 10390
people 10391
in 10392
the 10393
jungle--so 10394
wise 10395
that 10396
everyone 10397
else 10398
would 10399
notice 10400
and 10401
envy 10402
them. 10403
Therefore 10404
they 10405
followed 10406
Baloo 10407
and 10408
Bagheera 10409
and 10410
Mowgli 10411
through 10412
the 10413
jungle 10414
very 10415
quietly 10416
till 10417
it 10418
was 10419
time 10420
for 10421
the 10422
midday 10423
nap, 10424
and 10425
Mowgli, 10426
who 10427
was 10428
very 10429
much 10430
ashamed 10431
of 10432
himself, 10433
slept 10434
between 10435
the 10436
Panther 10437
and 10438
the 10439
Bear, 10440
resolving 10441
to 10442
have 10443
no 10444
more 10445
to 10446
do 10447
with 10448
the 10449
Monkey 10450
People. 10451
 10452
The 10453
next 10454
thing 10455
he 10456
remembered 10457
was 10458
feeling 10459
hands 10460
on 10461
his 10462
legs 10463
and 10464
arms--hard, 10465
strong, 10466
little 10467
hands--and 10468
then 10469
a 10470
swash 10471
of 10472
branches 10473
in 10474
his 10475
face, 10476
and 10477
then 10478
he 10479
was 10480
staring 10481
down 10482
through 10483
the 10484
swaying 10485
boughs 10486
as 10487
Baloo 10488
woke 10489
the 10490
jungle 10491
with 10492
his 10493
deep 10494
cries 10495
and 10496
Bagheera 10497
bounded 10498
up 10499
the 10500
trunk 10501
with 10502
every 10503
tooth 10504
bared. 10505
The 10506
Bandar-log 10507
howled 10508
with 10509
triumph 10510
and 10511
scuffled 10512
away 10513
to 10514
the 10515
upper 10516
branches 10517
where 10518
Bagheera 10519
dared 10520
not 10521
follow, 10522
shouting: 10523
“He 10524
has 10525
noticed 10526
us! 10527
Bagheera 10528
has 10529
noticed 10530
us. 10531
All 10532
the 10533
Jungle-People 10534
admire 10535
us 10536
for 10537
our 10538
skill 10539
and 10540
our 10541
cunning.” 10542
Then 10543
they 10544
began 10545
their 10546
flight; 10547
and 10548
the 10549
flight 10550
of 10551
the 10552
Monkey-People 10553
through 10554
tree-land 10555
is 10556
one 10557
of 10558
the 10559
things 10560
nobody 10561
can 10562
describe. 10563
They 10564
have 10565
their 10566
regular 10567
roads 10568
and 10569
crossroads, 10570
up 10571
hills 10572
and 10573
down 10574
hills, 10575
all 10576
laid 10577
out 10578
from 10579
fifty 10580
to 10581
seventy 10582
or 10583
a 10584
hundred 10585
feet 10586
above 10587
ground, 10588
and 10589
by 10590
these 10591
they 10592
can 10593
travel 10594
even 10595
at 10596
night 10597
if 10598
necessary. 10599
Two 10600
of 10601
the 10602
strongest 10603
monkeys 10604
caught 10605
Mowgli 10606
under 10607
the 10608
arms 10609
and 10610
swung 10611
off 10612
with 10613
him 10614
through 10615
the 10616
treetops, 10617
twenty 10618
feet 10619
at 10620
a 10621
bound. 10622
Had 10623
they 10624
been 10625
alone 10626
they 10627
could 10628
have 10629
gone 10630
twice 10631
as 10632
fast, 10633
but 10634
the 10635
boy’s 10636
weight 10637
held 10638
them 10639
back. 10640
Sick 10641
and 10642
giddy 10643
as 10644
Mowgli 10645
was 10646
he 10647
could 10648
not 10649
help 10650
enjoying 10651
the 10652
wild 10653
rush, 10654
though 10655
the 10656
glimpses 10657
of 10658
earth 10659
far 10660
down 10661
below 10662
frightened 10663
him, 10664
and 10665
the 10666
terrible 10667
check 10668
and 10669
jerk 10670
at 10671
the 10672
end 10673
of 10674
the 10675
swing 10676
over 10677
nothing 10678
but 10679
empty 10680
air 10681
brought 10682
his 10683
heart 10684
between 10685
his 10686
teeth. 10687
His 10688
escort 10689
would 10690
rush 10691
him 10692
up 10693
a 10694
tree 10695
till 10696
he 10697
felt 10698
the 10699
thinnest 10700
topmost 10701
branches 10702
crackle 10703
and 10704
bend 10705
under 10706
them, 10707
and 10708
then 10709
with 10710
a 10711
cough 10712
and 10713
a 10714
whoop 10715
would 10716
fling 10717
themselves 10718
into 10719
the 10720
air 10721
outward 10722
and 10723
downward, 10724
and 10725
bring 10726
up, 10727
hanging 10728
by 10729
their 10730
hands 10731
or 10732
their 10733
feet 10734
to 10735
the 10736
lower 10737
limbs 10738
of 10739
the 10740
next 10741
tree. 10742
Sometimes 10743
he 10744
could 10745
see 10746
for 10747
miles 10748
and 10749
miles 10750
across 10751
the 10752
still 10753
green 10754
jungle, 10755
as 10756
a 10757
man 10758
on 10759
the 10760
top 10761
of 10762
a 10763
mast 10764
can 10765
see 10766
for 10767
miles 10768
across 10769
the 10770
sea, 10771
and 10772
then 10773
the 10774
branches 10775
and 10776
leaves 10777
would 10778
lash 10779
him 10780
across 10781
the 10782
face, 10783
and 10784
he 10785
and 10786
his 10787
two 10788
guards 10789
would 10790
be 10791
almost 10792
down 10793
to 10794
earth 10795
again. 10796
So, 10797
bounding 10798
and 10799
crashing 10800
and 10801
whooping 10802
and 10803
yelling, 10804
the 10805
whole 10806
tribe 10807
of 10808
Bandar-log 10809
swept 10810
along 10811
the 10812
tree-roads 10813
with 10814
Mowgli 10815
their 10816
prisoner. 10817
 10818
For 10819
a 10820
time 10821
he 10822
was 10823
afraid 10824
of 10825
being 10826
dropped. 10827
Then 10828
he 10829
grew 10830
angry 10831
but 10832
knew 10833
better 10834
than 10835
to 10836
struggle, 10837
and 10838
then 10839
he 10840
began 10841
to 10842
think. 10843
The 10844
first 10845
thing 10846
was 10847
to 10848
send 10849
back 10850
word 10851
to 10852
Baloo 10853
and 10854
Bagheera, 10855
for, 10856
at 10857
the 10858
pace 10859
the 10860
monkeys 10861
were 10862
going, 10863
he 10864
knew 10865
his 10866
friends 10867
would 10868
be 10869
left 10870
far 10871
behind. 10872
It 10873
was 10874
useless 10875
to 10876
look 10877
down, 10878
for 10879
he 10880
could 10881
only 10882
see 10883
the 10884
topsides 10885
of 10886
the 10887
branches, 10888
so 10889
he 10890
stared 10891
upward 10892
and 10893
saw, 10894
far 10895
away 10896
in 10897
the 10898
blue, 10899
Rann 10900
the 10901
Kite 10902
balancing 10903
and 10904
wheeling 10905
as 10906
he 10907
kept 10908
watch 10909
over 10910
the 10911
jungle 10912
waiting 10913
for 10914
things 10915
to 10916
die. 10917
Rann 10918
saw 10919
that 10920
the 10921
monkeys 10922
were 10923
carrying 10924
something, 10925
and 10926
dropped 10927
a 10928
few 10929
hundred 10930
yards 10931
to 10932
find 10933
out 10934
whether 10935
their 10936
load 10937
was 10938
good 10939
to 10940
eat. 10941
He 10942
whistled 10943
with 10944
surprise 10945
when 10946
he 10947
saw 10948
Mowgli 10949
being 10950
dragged 10951
up 10952
to 10953
a 10954
treetop 10955
and 10956
heard 10957
him 10958
give 10959
the 10960
Kite 10961
call 10962
for--“We 10963
be 10964
of 10965
one 10966
blood, 10967
thou 10968
and 10969
I.” 10970
 10971
The 10972
waves 10973
of 10974
the 10975
branches 10976
closed 10977
over 10978
the 10979
boy, 10980
but 10981
Rann 10982
balanced 10983
away 10984
to 10985
the 10986
next 10987
tree 10988
in 10989
time 10990
to 10991
see 10992
the 10993
little 10994
brown 10995
face 10996
come 10997
up 10998
again. 10999
“Mark 11000
my 11001
trail!” 11002
Mowgli 11003
shouted. 11004
“Tell 11005
Baloo 11006
of 11007
the 11008
Seeonee 11009
Pack 11010
and 11011
Bagheera 11012
of 11013
the 11014
Council 11015
Rock.” 11016
 11017
“In 11018
whose 11019
name, 11020
Brother?” 11021
Rann 11022
had 11023
never 11024
seen 11025
Mowgli 11026
before, 11027
though 11028
of 11029
course 11030
he 11031
had 11032
heard 11033
of 11034
him. 11035
 11036
“Mowgli, 11037
the 11038
Frog. 11039
Man-cub 11040
they 11041
call 11042
me! 11043
Mark 11044
my 11045
trail!” 11046
 11047
The 11048
last 11049
words 11050
were 11051
shrieked 11052
as 11053
he 11054
was 11055
being 11056
swung 11057
through 11058
the 11059
air, 11060
but 11061
Rann 11062
nodded 11063
and 11064
rose 11065
up 11066
till 11067
he 11068
looked 11069
no 11070
bigger 11071
than 11072
a 11073
speck 11074
of 11075
dust, 11076
and 11077
there 11078
he 11079
hung, 11080
watching 11081
with 11082
his 11083
telescope 11084
eyes 11085
the 11086
swaying 11087
of 11088
the 11089
treetops 11090
as 11091
Mowgli’s 11092
escort 11093
whirled 11094
along. 11095
 11096
“They 11097
never 11098
go 11099
far,” 11100
he 11101
said 11102
with 11103
a 11104
chuckle. 11105
“They 11106
never 11107
do 11108
what 11109
they 11110
set 11111
out 11112
to 11113
do. 11114
Always 11115
pecking 11116
at 11117
new 11118
things 11119
are 11120
the 11121
Bandar-log. 11122
This 11123
time, 11124
if 11125
I 11126
have 11127
any 11128
eye-sight, 11129
they 11130
have 11131
pecked 11132
down 11133
trouble 11134
for 11135
themselves, 11136
for 11137
Baloo 11138
is 11139
no 11140
fledgling 11141
and 11142
Bagheera 11143
can, 11144
as 11145
I 11146
know, 11147
kill 11148
more 11149
than 11150
goats.” 11151
 11152
So 11153
he 11154
rocked 11155
on 11156
his 11157
wings, 11158
his 11159
feet 11160
gathered 11161
up 11162
under 11163
him, 11164
and 11165
waited. 11166
 11167
Meantime, 11168
Baloo 11169
and 11170
Bagheera 11171
were 11172
furious 11173
with 11174
rage 11175
and 11176
grief. 11177
Bagheera 11178
climbed 11179
as 11180
he 11181
had 11182
never 11183
climbed 11184
before, 11185
but 11186
the 11187
thin 11188
branches 11189
broke 11190
beneath 11191
his 11192
weight, 11193
and 11194
he 11195
slipped 11196
down, 11197
his 11198
claws 11199
full 11200
of 11201
bark. 11202
 11203
“Why 11204
didst 11205
thou 11206
not 11207
warn 11208
the 11209
man-cub?” 11210
he 11211
roared 11212
to 11213
poor 11214
Baloo, 11215
who 11216
had 11217
set 11218
off 11219
at 11220
a 11221
clumsy 11222
trot 11223
in 11224
the 11225
hope 11226
of 11227
overtaking 11228
the 11229
monkeys. 11230
“What 11231
was 11232
the 11233
use 11234
of 11235
half 11236
slaying 11237
him 11238
with 11239
blows 11240
if 11241
thou 11242
didst 11243
not 11244
warn 11245
him?” 11246
 11247
“Haste! 11248
O 11249
haste! 11250
We--we 11251
may 11252
catch 11253
them 11254
yet!” 11255
Baloo 11256
panted. 11257
 11258
“At 11259
that 11260
speed! 11261
It 11262
would 11263
not 11264
tire 11265
a 11266
wounded 11267
cow. 11268
Teacher 11269
of 11270
the 11271
Law--cub-beater--a 11272
mile 11273
of 11274
that 11275
rolling 11276
to 11277
and 11278
fro 11279
would 11280
burst 11281
thee 11282
open. 11283
Sit 11284
still 11285
and 11286
think! 11287
Make 11288
a 11289
plan. 11290
This 11291
is 11292
no 11293
time 11294
for 11295
chasing. 11296
They 11297
may 11298
drop 11299
him 11300
if 11301
we 11302
follow 11303
too 11304
close.” 11305
 11306
“Arrula! 11307
Whoo! 11308
They 11309
may 11310
have 11311
dropped 11312
him 11313
already, 11314
being 11315
tired 11316
of 11317
carrying 11318
him. 11319
Who 11320
can 11321
trust 11322
the 11323
Bandar-log? 11324
Put 11325
dead 11326
bats 11327
on 11328
my 11329
head! 11330
Give 11331
me 11332
black 11333
bones 11334
to 11335
eat! 11336
Roll 11337
me 11338
into 11339
the 11340
hives 11341
of 11342
the 11343
wild 11344
bees 11345
that 11346
I 11347
may 11348
be 11349
stung 11350
to 11351
death, 11352
and 11353
bury 11354
me 11355
with 11356
the 11357
Hyaena, 11358
for 11359
I 11360
am 11361
most 11362
miserable 11363
of 11364
bears! 11365
Arulala! 11366
Wahooa! 11367
O 11368
Mowgli, 11369
Mowgli! 11370
Why 11371
did 11372
I 11373
not 11374
warn 11375
thee 11376
against 11377
the 11378
Monkey-Folk 11379
instead 11380
of 11381
breaking 11382
thy 11383
head? 11384
Now 11385
perhaps 11386
I 11387
may 11388
have 11389
knocked 11390
the 11391
day’s 11392
lesson 11393
out 11394
of 11395
his 11396
mind, 11397
and 11398
he 11399
will 11400
be 11401
alone 11402
in 11403
the 11404
jungle 11405
without 11406
the 11407
Master 11408
Words.” 11409
 11410
Baloo 11411
clasped 11412
his 11413
paws 11414
over 11415
his 11416
ears 11417
and 11418
rolled 11419
to 11420
and 11421
fro 11422
moaning. 11423
 11424
“At 11425
least 11426
he 11427
gave 11428
me 11429
all 11430
the 11431
Words 11432
correctly 11433
a 11434
little 11435
time 11436
ago,” 11437
said 11438
Bagheera 11439
impatiently. 11440
“Baloo, 11441
thou 11442
hast 11443
neither 11444
memory 11445
nor 11446
respect. 11447
What 11448
would 11449
the 11450
jungle 11451
think 11452
if 11453
I, 11454
the 11455
Black 11456
Panther, 11457
curled 11458
myself 11459
up 11460
like 11461
Ikki 11462
the 11463
Porcupine, 11464
and 11465
howled?” 11466
 11467
“What 11468
do 11469
I 11470
care 11471
what 11472
the 11473
jungle 11474
thinks? 11475
He 11476
may 11477
be 11478
dead 11479
by 11480
now.” 11481
 11482
“Unless 11483
and 11484
until 11485
they 11486
drop 11487
him 11488
from 11489
the 11490
branches 11491
in 11492
sport, 11493
or 11494
kill 11495
him 11496
out 11497
of 11498
idleness, 11499
I 11500
have 11501
no 11502
fear 11503
for 11504
the 11505
man-cub. 11506
He 11507
is 11508
wise 11509
and 11510
well 11511
taught, 11512
and 11513
above 11514
all 11515
he 11516
has 11517
the 11518
eyes 11519
that 11520
make 11521
the 11522
Jungle-People 11523
afraid. 11524
But 11525
(and 11526
it 11527
is 11528
a 11529
great 11530
evil) 11531
he 11532
is 11533
in 11534
the 11535
power 11536
of 11537
the 11538
Bandar-log, 11539
and 11540
they, 11541
because 11542
they 11543
live 11544
in 11545
trees, 11546
have 11547
no 11548
fear 11549
of 11550
any 11551
of 11552
our 11553
people.” 11554
Bagheera 11555
licked 11556
one 11557
forepaw 11558
thoughtfully. 11559
 11560
“Fool 11561
that 11562
I 11563
am! 11564
Oh, 11565
fat, 11566
brown, 11567
root-digging 11568
fool 11569
that 11570
I 11571
am,” 11572
said 11573
Baloo, 11574
uncoiling 11575
himself 11576
with 11577
a 11578
jerk, 11579
“it 11580
is 11581
true 11582
what 11583
Hathi 11584
the 11585
Wild 11586
Elephant 11587
says: 11588
`To 11589
each 11590
his 11591
own 11592
fear’; 11593
and 11594
they, 11595
the 11596
Bandar-log, 11597
fear 11598
Kaa 11599
the 11600
Rock 11601
Snake. 11602
He 11603
can 11604
climb 11605
as 11606
well 11607
as 11608
they 11609
can. 11610
He 11611
steals 11612
the 11613
young 11614
monkeys 11615
in 11616
the 11617
night. 11618
The 11619
whisper 11620
of 11621
his 11622
name 11623
makes 11624
their 11625
wicked 11626
tails 11627
cold. 11628
Let 11629
us 11630
go 11631
to 11632
Kaa.” 11633
 11634
“What 11635
will 11636
he 11637
do 11638
for 11639
us? 11640
He 11641
is 11642
not 11643
of 11644
our 11645
tribe, 11646
being 11647
footless--and 11648
with 11649
most 11650
evil 11651
eyes,” 11652
said 11653
Bagheera. 11654
 11655
“He 11656
is 11657
very 11658
old 11659
and 11660
very 11661
cunning. 11662
Above 11663
all, 11664
he 11665
is 11666
always 11667
hungry,” 11668
said 11669
Baloo 11670
hopefully. 11671
“Promise 11672
him 11673
many 11674
goats.” 11675
 11676
“He 11677
sleeps 11678
for 11679
a 11680
full 11681
month 11682
after 11683
he 11684
has 11685
once 11686
eaten. 11687
He 11688
may 11689
be 11690
asleep 11691
now, 11692
and 11693
even 11694
were 11695
he 11696
awake 11697
what 11698
if 11699
he 11700
would 11701
rather 11702
kill 11703
his 11704
own 11705
goats?” 11706
 11707
Bagheera, 11708
who 11709
did 11710
not 11711
know 11712
much 11713
about 11714
Kaa, 11715
was 11716
naturally 11717
suspicious. 11718
 11719
“Then 11720
in 11721
that 11722
case, 11723
thou 11724
and 11725
I 11726
together, 11727
old 11728
hunter, 11729
might 11730
make 11731
him 11732
see 11733
reason.” 11734
Here 11735
Baloo 11736
rubbed 11737
his 11738
faded 11739
brown 11740
shoulder 11741
against 11742
the 11743
Panther, 11744
and 11745
they 11746
went 11747
off 11748
to 11749
look 11750
for 11751
Kaa 11752
the 11753
Rock 11754
Python. 11755
 11756
They 11757
found 11758
him 11759
stretched 11760
out 11761
on 11762
a 11763
warm 11764
ledge 11765
in 11766
the 11767
afternoon 11768
sun, 11769
admiring 11770
his 11771
beautiful 11772
new 11773
coat, 11774
for 11775
he 11776
had 11777
been 11778
in 11779
retirement 11780
for 11781
the 11782
last 11783
ten 11784
days 11785
changing 11786
his 11787
skin, 11788
and 11789
now 11790
he 11791
was 11792
very 11793
splendid--darting 11794
his 11795
big 11796
blunt-nosed 11797
head 11798
along 11799
the 11800
ground, 11801
and 11802
twisting 11803
the 11804
thirty 11805
feet 11806
of 11807
his 11808
body 11809
into 11810
fantastic 11811
knots 11812
and 11813
curves, 11814
and 11815
licking 11816
his 11817
lips 11818
as 11819
he 11820
thought 11821
of 11822
his 11823
dinner 11824
to 11825
come. 11826
 11827
“He 11828
has 11829
not 11830
eaten,” 11831
said 11832
Baloo, 11833
with 11834
a 11835
grunt 11836
of 11837
relief, 11838
as 11839
soon 11840
as 11841
he 11842
saw 11843
the 11844
beautifully 11845
mottled 11846
brown 11847
and 11848
yellow 11849
jacket. 11850
“Be 11851
careful, 11852
Bagheera! 11853
He 11854
is 11855
always 11856
a 11857
little 11858
blind 11859
after 11860
he 11861
has 11862
changed 11863
his 11864
skin, 11865
and 11866
very 11867
quick 11868
to 11869
strike.” 11870
 11871
Kaa 11872
was 11873
not 11874
a 11875
poison 11876
snake--in 11877
fact 11878
he 11879
rather 11880
despised 11881
the 11882
poison 11883
snakes 11884
as 11885
cowards--but 11886
his 11887
strength 11888
lay 11889
in 11890
his 11891
hug, 11892
and 11893
when 11894
he 11895
had 11896
once 11897
lapped 11898
his 11899
huge 11900
coils 11901
round 11902
anybody 11903
there 11904
was 11905
no 11906
more 11907
to 11908
be 11909
said. 11910
“Good 11911
hunting!” 11912
cried 11913
Baloo, 11914
sitting 11915
up 11916
on 11917
his 11918
haunches. 11919
Like 11920
all 11921
snakes 11922
of 11923
his 11924
breed 11925
Kaa 11926
was 11927
rather 11928
deaf, 11929
and 11930
did 11931
not 11932
hear 11933
the 11934
call 11935
at 11936
first. 11937
Then 11938
he 11939
curled 11940
up 11941
ready 11942
for 11943
any 11944
accident, 11945
his 11946
head 11947
lowered. 11948
 11949
“Good 11950
hunting 11951
for 11952
us 11953
all,” 11954
he 11955
answered. 11956
“Oho, 11957
Baloo, 11958
what 11959
dost 11960
thou 11961
do 11962
here? 11963
Good 11964
hunting, 11965
Bagheera. 11966
One 11967
of 11968
us 11969
at 11970
least 11971
needs 11972
food. 11973
Is 11974
there 11975
any 11976
news 11977
of 11978
game 11979
afoot? 11980
A 11981
doe 11982
now, 11983
or 11984
even 11985
a 11986
young 11987
buck? 11988
I 11989
am 11990
as 11991
empty 11992
as 11993
a 11994
dried 11995
well.” 11996
 11997
“We 11998
are 11999
hunting,” 12000
said 12001
Baloo 12002
carelessly. 12003
He 12004
knew 12005
that 12006
you 12007
must 12008
not 12009
hurry 12010
Kaa. 12011
He 12012
is 12013
too 12014
big. 12015
 12016
“Give 12017
me 12018
permission 12019
to 12020
come 12021
with 12022
you,” 12023
said 12024
Kaa. 12025
“A 12026
blow 12027
more 12028
or 12029
less 12030
is 12031
nothing 12032
to 12033
thee, 12034
Bagheera 12035
or 12036
Baloo, 12037
but 12038
I--I 12039
have 12040
to 12041
wait 12042
and 12043
wait 12044
for 12045
days 12046
in 12047
a 12048
wood-path 12049
and 12050
climb 12051
half 12052
a 12053
night 12054
on 12055
the 12056
mere 12057
chance 12058
of 12059
a 12060
young 12061
ape. 12062
Psshaw! 12063
The 12064
branches 12065
are 12066
not 12067
what 12068
they 12069
were 12070
when 12071
I 12072
was 12073
young. 12074
Rotten 12075
twigs 12076
and 12077
dry 12078
boughs 12079
are 12080
they 12081
all.” 12082
 12083
“Maybe 12084
thy 12085
great 12086
weight 12087
has 12088
something 12089
to 12090
do 12091
with 12092
the 12093
matter,” 12094
said 12095
Baloo. 12096
 12097
“I 12098
am 12099
a 12100
fair 12101
length--a 12102
fair 12103
length,” 12104
said 12105
Kaa 12106
with 12107
a 12108
little 12109
pride. 12110
“But 12111
for 12112
all 12113
that, 12114
it 12115
is 12116
the 12117
fault 12118
of 12119
this 12120
new-grown 12121
timber. 12122
I 12123
came 12124
very 12125
near 12126
to 12127
falling 12128
on 12129
my 12130
last 12131
hunt--very 12132
near 12133
indeed--and 12134
the 12135
noise 12136
of 12137
my 12138
slipping, 12139
for 12140
my 12141
tail 12142
was 12143
not 12144
tight 12145
wrapped 12146
around 12147
the 12148
tree, 12149
waked 12150
the 12151
Bandar-log, 12152
and 12153
they 12154
called 12155
me 12156
most 12157
evil 12158
names.” 12159
 12160
“Footless, 12161
yellow 12162
earth-worm,” 12163
said 12164
Bagheera 12165
under 12166
his 12167
whiskers, 12168
as 12169
though 12170
he 12171
were 12172
trying 12173
to 12174
remember 12175
something. 12176
 12177
“Sssss! 12178
Have 12179
they 12180
ever 12181
called 12182
me 12183
that?” 12184
said 12185
Kaa. 12186
 12187
“Something 12188
of 12189
that 12190
kind 12191
it 12192
was 12193
that 12194
they 12195
shouted 12196
to 12197
us 12198
last 12199
moon, 12200
but 12201
we 12202
never 12203
noticed 12204
them. 12205
They 12206
will 12207
say 12208
anything--even 12209
that 12210
thou 12211
hast 12212
lost 12213
all 12214
thy 12215
teeth, 12216
and 12217
wilt 12218
not 12219
face 12220
anything 12221
bigger 12222
than 12223
a 12224
kid, 12225
because 12226
(they 12227
are 12228
indeed 12229
shameless, 12230
these 12231
Bandar-log)--because 12232
thou 12233
art 12234
afraid 12235
of 12236
the 12237
he-goat’s 12238
horns,” 12239
Bagheera 12240
went 12241
on 12242
sweetly. 12243
 12244
Now 12245
a 12246
snake, 12247
especially 12248
a 12249
wary 12250
old 12251
python 12252
like 12253
Kaa, 12254
very 12255
seldom 12256
shows 12257
that 12258
he 12259
is 12260
angry, 12261
but 12262
Baloo 12263
and 12264
Bagheera 12265
could 12266
see 12267
the 12268
big 12269
swallowing 12270
muscles 12271
on 12272
either 12273
side 12274
of 12275
Kaa’s 12276
throat 12277
ripple 12278
and 12279
bulge. 12280
 12281
“The 12282
Bandar-log 12283
have 12284
shifted 12285
their 12286
grounds,” 12287
he 12288
said 12289
quietly. 12290
“When 12291
I 12292
came 12293
up 12294
into 12295
the 12296
sun 12297
today 12298
I 12299
heard 12300
them 12301
whooping 12302
among 12303
the 12304
tree-tops.” 12305
 12306
“It--it 12307
is 12308
the 12309
Bandar-log 12310
that 12311
we 12312
follow 12313
now,” 12314
said 12315
Baloo, 12316
but 12317
the 12318
words 12319
stuck 12320
in 12321
his 12322
throat, 12323
for 12324
that 12325
was 12326
the 12327
first 12328
time 12329
in 12330
his 12331
memory 12332
that 12333
one 12334
of 12335
the 12336
Jungle-People 12337
had 12338
owned 12339
to 12340
being 12341
interested 12342
in 12343
the 12344
doings 12345
of 12346
the 12347
monkeys. 12348
 12349
“Beyond 12350
doubt 12351
then 12352
it 12353
is 12354
no 12355
small 12356
thing 12357
that 12358
takes 12359
two 12360
such 12361
hunters--leaders 12362
in 12363
their 12364
own 12365
jungle 12366
I 12367
am 12368
certain--on 12369
the 12370
trail 12371
of 12372
the 12373
Bandar-log,” 12374
Kaa 12375
replied 12376
courteously, 12377
as 12378
he 12379
swelled 12380
with 12381
curiosity. 12382
 12383
“Indeed,” 12384
Baloo 12385
began, 12386
“I 12387
am 12388
no 12389
more 12390
than 12391
the 12392
old 12393
and 12394
sometimes 12395
very 12396
foolish 12397
Teacher 12398
of 12399
the 12400
Law 12401
to 12402
the 12403
Seeonee 12404
wolf-cubs, 12405
and 12406
Bagheera 12407
here--” 12408
 12409
“Is 12410
Bagheera,” 12411
said 12412
the 12413
Black 12414
Panther, 12415
and 12416
his 12417
jaws 12418
shut 12419
with 12420
a 12421
snap, 12422
for 12423
he 12424
did 12425
not 12426
believe 12427
in 12428
being 12429
humble. 12430
“The 12431
trouble 12432
is 12433
this, 12434
Kaa. 12435
Those 12436
nut-stealers 12437
and 12438
pickers 12439
of 12440
palm 12441
leaves 12442
have 12443
stolen 12444
away 12445
our 12446
man-cub 12447
of 12448
whom 12449
thou 12450
hast 12451
perhaps 12452
heard.” 12453
 12454
“I 12455
heard 12456
some 12457
news 12458
from 12459
Ikki 12460
(his 12461
quills 12462
make 12463
him 12464
presumptuous) 12465
of 12466
a 12467
man-thing 12468
that 12469
was 12470
entered 12471
into 12472
a 12473
wolf 12474
pack, 12475
but 12476
I 12477
did 12478
not 12479
believe. 12480
Ikki 12481
is 12482
full 12483
of 12484
stories 12485
half 12486
heard 12487
and 12488
very 12489
badly 12490
told.” 12491
 12492
“But 12493
it 12494
is 12495
true. 12496
He 12497
is 12498
such 12499
a 12500
man-cub 12501
as 12502
never 12503
was,” 12504
said 12505
Baloo. 12506
“The 12507
best 12508
and 12509
wisest 12510
and 12511
boldest 12512
of 12513
man-cubs--my 12514
own 12515
pupil, 12516
who 12517
shall 12518
make 12519
the 12520
name 12521
of 12522
Baloo 12523
famous 12524
through 12525
all 12526
the 12527
jungles; 12528
and 12529
besides, 12530
I--we--love 12531
him, 12532
Kaa.” 12533
 12534
“Ts! 12535
Ts!” 12536
said 12537
Kaa, 12538
weaving 12539
his 12540
head 12541
to 12542
and 12543
fro. 12544
“I 12545
also 12546
have 12547
known 12548
what 12549
love 12550
is. 12551
There 12552
are 12553
tales 12554
I 12555
could 12556
tell 12557
that--” 12558
 12559
“That 12560
need 12561
a 12562
clear 12563
night 12564
when 12565
we 12566
are 12567
all 12568
well 12569
fed 12570
to 12571
praise 12572
properly,” 12573
 12574
said 12575
Bagheera 12576
quickly. 12577
“Our 12578
man-cub 12579
is 12580
in 12581
the 12582
hands 12583
of 12584
the 12585
Bandar-log 12586
now, 12587
and 12588
we 12589
know 12590
that 12591
of 12592
all 12593
the 12594
Jungle-People 12595
they 12596
fear 12597
Kaa 12598
alone.” 12599
 12600
“They 12601
fear 12602
me 12603
alone. 12604
They 12605
have 12606
good 12607
reason,” 12608
said 12609
Kaa. 12610
“Chattering, 12611
foolish, 12612
vain--vain, 12613
foolish, 12614
and 12615
chattering, 12616
are 12617
the 12618
monkeys. 12619
But 12620
a 12621
man-thing 12622
in 12623
their 12624
hands 12625
is 12626
in 12627
no 12628
good 12629
luck. 12630
They 12631
grow 12632
tired 12633
of 12634
the 12635
nuts 12636
they 12637
pick, 12638
and 12639
throw 12640
them 12641
down. 12642
They 12643
carry 12644
a 12645
branch 12646
half 12647
a 12648
day, 12649
meaning 12650
to 12651
do 12652
great 12653
things 12654
with 12655
it, 12656
and 12657
then 12658
they 12659
snap 12660
it 12661
in 12662
two. 12663
That 12664
man-thing 12665
is 12666
not 12667
to 12668
be 12669
envied. 12670
They 12671
called 12672
me 12673
also--`yellow 12674
fish’ 12675
was 12676
it 12677
not?” 12678
 12679
“Worm--worm--earth-worm,” 12680
said 12681
Bagheera, 12682
“as 12683
well 12684
as 12685
other 12686
things 12687
which 12688
I 12689
cannot 12690
now 12691
say 12692
for 12693
shame.” 12694
 12695
“We 12696
must 12697
remind 12698
them 12699
to 12700
speak 12701
well 12702
of 12703
their 12704
master. 12705
Aaa-ssp! 12706
We 12707
must 12708
help 12709
their 12710
wandering 12711
memories. 12712
Now, 12713
whither 12714
went 12715
they 12716
with 12717
the 12718
cub?” 12719
 12720
“The 12721
jungle 12722
alone 12723
knows. 12724
Toward 12725
the 12726
sunset, 12727
I 12728
believe,” 12729
said 12730
Baloo. 12731
“We 12732
had 12733
thought 12734
that 12735
thou 12736
wouldst 12737
know, 12738
Kaa.” 12739
 12740
“I? 12741
How? 12742
I 12743
take 12744
them 12745
when 12746
they 12747
come 12748
in 12749
my 12750
way, 12751
but 12752
I 12753
do 12754
not 12755
hunt 12756
the 12757
Bandar-log, 12758
or 12759
frogs--or 12760
green 12761
scum 12762
on 12763
a 12764
water-hole, 12765
for 12766
that 12767
matter.” 12768
 12769
“Up, 12770
Up! 12771
Up, 12772
Up! 12773
Hillo! 12774
Illo! 12775
Illo, 12776
look 12777
up, 12778
Baloo 12779
of 12780
the 12781
Seeonee 12782
Wolf 12783
Pack!” 12784
 12785
Baloo 12786
looked 12787
up 12788
to 12789
see 12790
where 12791
the 12792
voice 12793
came 12794
from, 12795
and 12796
there 12797
was 12798
Rann 12799
the 12800
Kite, 12801
sweeping 12802
down 12803
with 12804
the 12805
sun 12806
shining 12807
on 12808
the 12809
upturned 12810
flanges 12811
of 12812
his 12813
wings. 12814
It 12815
was 12816
near 12817
Rann’s 12818
bedtime, 12819
but 12820
he 12821
had 12822
ranged 12823
all 12824
over 12825
the 12826
jungle 12827
looking 12828
for 12829
the 12830
Bear 12831
and 12832
had 12833
missed 12834
him 12835
in 12836
the 12837
thick 12838
foliage. 12839
 12840
“What 12841
is 12842
it?” 12843
said 12844
Baloo. 12845
 12846
“I 12847
have 12848
seen 12849
Mowgli 12850
among 12851
the 12852
Bandar-log. 12853
He 12854
bade 12855
me 12856
tell 12857
you. 12858
I 12859
watched. 12860
The 12861
Bandar-log 12862
have 12863
taken 12864
him 12865
beyond 12866
the 12867
river 12868
to 12869
the 12870
monkey 12871
city--to 12872
the 12873
Cold 12874
Lairs. 12875
They 12876
may 12877
stay 12878
there 12879
for 12880
a 12881
night, 12882
or 12883
ten 12884
nights, 12885
or 12886
an 12887
hour. 12888
I 12889
have 12890
told 12891
the 12892
bats 12893
to 12894
watch 12895
through 12896
the 12897
dark 12898
time. 12899
That 12900
is 12901
my 12902
message. 12903
Good 12904
hunting, 12905
all 12906
you 12907
below!” 12908
 12909
“Full 12910
gorge 12911
and 12912
a 12913
deep 12914
sleep 12915
to 12916
you, 12917
Rann,” 12918
cried 12919
Bagheera. 12920
“I 12921
will 12922
remember 12923
thee 12924
in 12925
my 12926
next 12927
kill, 12928
and 12929
put 12930
aside 12931
the 12932
head 12933
for 12934
thee 12935
alone, 12936
O 12937
best 12938
of 12939
kites!” 12940
 12941
“It 12942
is 12943
nothing. 12944
It 12945
is 12946
nothing. 12947
The 12948
boy 12949
held 12950
the 12951
Master 12952
Word. 12953
I 12954
could 12955
have 12956
done 12957
no 12958
less,” 12959
and 12960
Rann 12961
circled 12962
up 12963
again 12964
to 12965
his 12966
roost. 12967
 12968
“He 12969
has 12970
not 12971
forgotten 12972
to 12973
use 12974
his 12975
tongue,” 12976
said 12977
Baloo 12978
with 12979
a 12980
chuckle 12981
of 12982
pride. 12983
“To 12984
think 12985
of 12986
one 12987
so 12988
young 12989
remembering 12990
the 12991
Master 12992
Word 12993
for 12994
the 12995
birds 12996
too 12997
while 12998
he 12999
was 13000
being 13001
pulled 13002
across 13003
trees!” 13004
 13005
“It 13006
was 13007
most 13008
firmly 13009
driven 13010
into 13011
him,” 13012
said 13013
Bagheera. 13014
“But 13015
I 13016
am 13017
proud 13018
of 13019
him, 13020
and 13021
now 13022
we 13023
must 13024
go 13025
to 13026
the 13027
Cold 13028
Lairs.” 13029
 13030
They 13031
all 13032
knew 13033
where 13034
that 13035
place 13036
was, 13037
but 13038
few 13039
of 13040
the 13041
Jungle 13042
People 13043
ever 13044
went 13045
there, 13046
because 13047
what 13048
they 13049
called 13050
the 13051
Cold 13052
Lairs 13053
was 13054
an 13055
old 13056
deserted 13057
city, 13058
lost 13059
and 13060
buried 13061
in 13062
the 13063
jungle, 13064
and 13065
beasts 13066
seldom 13067
use 13068
a 13069
place 13070
that 13071
men 13072
have 13073
once 13074
used. 13075
The 13076
wild 13077
boar 13078
will, 13079
but 13080
the 13081
hunting 13082
tribes 13083
do 13084
not. 13085
Besides, 13086
the 13087
monkeys 13088
lived 13089
there 13090
as 13091
much 13092
as 13093
they 13094
could 13095
be 13096
said 13097
to 13098
live 13099
anywhere, 13100
and 13101
no 13102
self-respecting 13103
animal 13104
would 13105
come 13106
within 13107
eyeshot 13108
of 13109
it 13110
except 13111
in 13112
times 13113
of 13114
drought, 13115
when 13116
the 13117
half-ruined 13118
tanks 13119
and 13120
reservoirs 13121
held 13122
a 13123
little 13124
water. 13125
 13126
[Illustration: 13127
The 13128
“Cold 13129
Lairs”] 13130
 13131
“It 13132
is 13133
half 13134
a 13135
night’s 13136
journey--at 13137
full 13138
speed,” 13139
said 13140
Bagheera, 13141
and 13142
Baloo 13143
looked 13144
very 13145
serious. 13146
“I 13147
will 13148
go 13149
as 13150
fast 13151
as 13152
I 13153
can,” 13154
he 13155
said 13156
anxiously. 13157
 13158
“We 13159
dare 13160
not 13161
wait 13162
for 13163
thee. 13164
Follow, 13165
Baloo. 13166
We 13167
must 13168
go 13169
on 13170
the 13171
quick-foot--Kaa 13172
and 13173
I.” 13174
 13175
“Feet 13176
or 13177
no 13178
feet, 13179
I 13180
can 13181
keep 13182
abreast 13183
of 13184
all 13185
thy 13186
four,” 13187
said 13188
Kaa 13189
shortly. 13190
Baloo 13191
made 13192
one 13193
effort 13194
to 13195
hurry, 13196
but 13197
had 13198
to 13199
sit 13200
down 13201
panting, 13202
and 13203
so 13204
they 13205
left 13206
him 13207
to 13208
come 13209
on 13210
later, 13211
while 13212
Bagheera 13213
hurried 13214
forward, 13215
at 13216
the 13217
quick 13218
panther-canter. 13219
Kaa 13220
said 13221
nothing, 13222
but, 13223
strive 13224
as 13225
Bagheera 13226
might, 13227
the 13228
huge 13229
Rock-python 13230
held 13231
level 13232
with 13233
him. 13234
When 13235
they 13236
came 13237
to 13238
a 13239
hill 13240
stream, 13241
Bagheera 13242
gained, 13243
because 13244
he 13245
bounded 13246
across 13247
while 13248
Kaa 13249
swam, 13250
his 13251
head 13252
and 13253
two 13254
feet 13255
of 13256
his 13257
neck 13258
clearing 13259
the 13260
water, 13261
but 13262
on 13263
level 13264
ground 13265
Kaa 13266
made 13267
up 13268
the 13269
distance. 13270
 13271
“By 13272
the 13273
Broken 13274
Lock 13275
that 13276
freed 13277
me,” 13278
said 13279
Bagheera, 13280
when 13281
twilight 13282
had 13283
fallen, 13284
“thou 13285
art 13286
no 13287
slow 13288
goer!” 13289
 13290
“I 13291
am 13292
hungry,” 13293
said 13294
Kaa. 13295
“Besides, 13296
they 13297
called 13298
me 13299
speckled 13300
frog.” 13301
 13302
“Worm--earth-worm, 13303
and 13304
yellow 13305
to 13306
boot.” 13307
 13308
“All 13309
one. 13310
Let 13311
us 13312
go 13313
on,” 13314
and 13315
Kaa 13316
seemed 13317
to 13318
pour 13319
himself 13320
along 13321
the 13322
ground, 13323
finding 13324
the 13325
shortest 13326
road 13327
with 13328
his 13329
steady 13330
eyes, 13331
and 13332
keeping 13333
to 13334
it. 13335
 13336
In 13337
the 13338
Cold 13339
Lairs 13340
the 13341
Monkey-People 13342
were 13343
not 13344
thinking 13345
of 13346
Mowgli’s 13347
friends 13348
at 13349
all. 13350
They 13351
had 13352
brought 13353
the 13354
boy 13355
to 13356
the 13357
Lost 13358
City, 13359
and 13360
were 13361
very 13362
much 13363
pleased 13364
with 13365
themselves 13366
for 13367
the 13368
time. 13369
Mowgli 13370
had 13371
never 13372
seen 13373
an 13374
Indian 13375
city 13376
before, 13377
and 13378
though 13379
this 13380
was 13381
almost 13382
a 13383
heap 13384
of 13385
ruins 13386
it 13387
seemed 13388
very 13389
wonderful 13390
and 13391
splendid. 13392
Some 13393
king 13394
had 13395
built 13396
it 13397
long 13398
ago 13399
on 13400
a 13401
little 13402
hill. 13403
You 13404
could 13405
still 13406
trace 13407
the 13408
stone 13409
causeways 13410
that 13411
led 13412
up 13413
to 13414
the 13415
ruined 13416
gates 13417
where 13418
the 13419
last 13420
splinters 13421
of 13422
wood 13423
hung 13424
to 13425
the 13426
worn, 13427
rusted 13428
hinges. 13429
Trees 13430
had 13431
grown 13432
into 13433
and 13434
out 13435
of 13436
the 13437
walls; 13438
the 13439
battlements 13440
were 13441
tumbled 13442
down 13443
and 13444
decayed, 13445
and 13446
wild 13447
creepers 13448
hung 13449
out 13450
of 13451
the 13452
windows 13453
of 13454
the 13455
towers 13456
on 13457
the 13458
walls 13459
in 13460
bushy 13461
hanging 13462
clumps. 13463
 13464
A 13465
great 13466
roofless 13467
palace 13468
crowned 13469
the 13470
hill, 13471
and 13472
the 13473
marble 13474
of 13475
the 13476
courtyards 13477
and 13478
the 13479
fountains 13480
was 13481
split, 13482
and 13483
stained 13484
with 13485
red 13486
and 13487
green, 13488
and 13489
the 13490
very 13491
cobblestones 13492
in 13493
the 13494
courtyard 13495
where 13496
the 13497
king’s 13498
elephants 13499
used 13500
to 13501
live 13502
had 13503
been 13504
thrust 13505
up 13506
and 13507
apart 13508
by 13509
grasses 13510
and 13511
young 13512
trees. 13513
From 13514
the 13515
palace 13516
you 13517
could 13518
see 13519
the 13520
rows 13521
and 13522
rows 13523
of 13524
roofless 13525
houses 13526
that 13527
made 13528
up 13529
the 13530
city 13531
looking 13532
like 13533
empty 13534
honeycombs 13535
filled 13536
with 13537
blackness; 13538
the 13539
shapeless 13540
block 13541
of 13542
stone 13543
that 13544
had 13545
been 13546
an 13547
idol 13548
in 13549
the 13550
square 13551
where 13552
four 13553
roads 13554
met; 13555
the 13556
pits 13557
and 13558
dimples 13559
at 13560
street 13561
corners 13562
where 13563
the 13564
public 13565
wells 13566
once 13567
stood, 13568
and 13569
the 13570
shattered 13571
domes 13572
of 13573
temples 13574
with 13575
wild 13576
figs 13577
sprouting 13578
on 13579
their 13580
sides. 13581
The 13582
monkeys 13583
called 13584
the 13585
place 13586
their 13587
city, 13588
and 13589
pretended 13590
to 13591
despise 13592
the 13593
Jungle-People 13594
because 13595
they 13596
lived 13597
in 13598
the 13599
forest. 13600
And 13601
yet 13602
they 13603
never 13604
knew 13605
what 13606
the 13607
buildings 13608
were 13609
made 13610
for 13611
nor 13612
how 13613
to 13614
use 13615
them. 13616
They 13617
would 13618
sit 13619
in 13620
circles 13621
on 13622
the 13623
hall 13624
of 13625
the 13626
king’s 13627
council 13628
chamber, 13629
and 13630
scratch 13631
for 13632
fleas 13633
and 13634
pretend 13635
to 13636
be 13637
men; 13638
or 13639
they 13640
would 13641
run 13642
in 13643
and 13644
out 13645
of 13646
the 13647
roofless 13648
houses 13649
and 13650
collect 13651
pieces 13652
of 13653
plaster 13654
and 13655
old 13656
bricks 13657
in 13658
a 13659
corner, 13660
and 13661
forget 13662
where 13663
they 13664
had 13665
hidden 13666
them, 13667
and 13668
fight 13669
and 13670
cry 13671
in 13672
scuffling 13673
crowds, 13674
and 13675
then 13676
break 13677
off 13678
to 13679
play 13680
up 13681
and 13682
down 13683
the 13684
terraces 13685
of 13686
the 13687
king’s 13688
garden, 13689
where 13690
they 13691
would 13692
shake 13693
the 13694
rose 13695
trees 13696
and 13697
the 13698
oranges 13699
in 13700
sport 13701
to 13702
see 13703
the 13704
fruit 13705
and 13706
flowers 13707
fall. 13708
They 13709
explored 13710
all 13711
the 13712
passages 13713
and 13714
dark 13715
tunnels 13716
in 13717
the 13718
palace 13719
and 13720
the 13721
hundreds 13722
of 13723
little 13724
dark 13725
rooms, 13726
but 13727
they 13728
never 13729
remembered 13730
what 13731
they 13732
had 13733
seen 13734
and 13735
what 13736
they 13737
had 13738
not; 13739
and 13740
so 13741
drifted 13742
about 13743
in 13744
ones 13745
and 13746
twos 13747
or 13748
crowds 13749
telling 13750
each 13751
other 13752
that 13753
they 13754
were 13755
doing 13756
as 13757
men 13758
did. 13759
They 13760
drank 13761
at 13762
the 13763
tanks 13764
and 13765
made 13766
the 13767
water 13768
all 13769
muddy, 13770
and 13771
then 13772
they 13773
fought 13774
over 13775
it, 13776
and 13777
then 13778
they 13779
would 13780
all 13781
rush 13782
together 13783
in 13784
mobs 13785
and 13786
shout: 13787
“There 13788
is 13789
no 13790
one 13791
in 13792
the 13793
jungle 13794
so 13795
wise 13796
and 13797
good 13798
and 13799
clever 13800
and 13801
strong 13802
and 13803
gentle 13804
as 13805
the 13806
Bandar-log.” 13807
Then 13808
all 13809
would 13810
begin 13811
again 13812
till 13813
they 13814
grew 13815
tired 13816
of 13817
the 13818
city 13819
and 13820
went 13821
back 13822
to 13823
the 13824
tree-tops, 13825
hoping 13826
the 13827
Jungle-People 13828
would 13829
notice 13830
them. 13831
 13832
Mowgli, 13833
who 13834
had 13835
been 13836
trained 13837
under 13838
the 13839
Law 13840
of 13841
the 13842
Jungle, 13843
did 13844
not 13845
like 13846
or 13847
understand 13848
this 13849
kind 13850
of 13851
life. 13852
The 13853
monkeys 13854
dragged 13855
him 13856
into 13857
the 13858
Cold 13859
Lairs 13860
late 13861
in 13862
the 13863
afternoon, 13864
and 13865
instead 13866
of 13867
going 13868
to 13869
sleep, 13870
as 13871
Mowgli 13872
would 13873
have 13874
done 13875
after 13876
a 13877
long 13878
journey, 13879
they 13880
joined 13881
hands 13882
and 13883
danced 13884
about 13885
and 13886
sang 13887
their 13888
foolish 13889
songs. 13890
One 13891
of 13892
the 13893
monkeys 13894
made 13895
a 13896
speech 13897
and 13898
told 13899
his 13900
companions 13901
that 13902
Mowgli’s 13903
capture 13904
marked 13905
a 13906
new 13907
thing 13908
in 13909
the 13910
history 13911
of 13912
the 13913
Bandar-log, 13914
for 13915
Mowgli 13916
was 13917
going 13918
to 13919
show 13920
them 13921
how 13922
to 13923
weave 13924
sticks 13925
and 13926
canes 13927
together 13928
as 13929
a 13930
protection 13931
against 13932
rain 13933
and 13934
cold. 13935
Mowgli 13936
picked 13937
up 13938
some 13939
creepers 13940
and 13941
began 13942
to 13943
work 13944
them 13945
in 13946
and 13947
out, 13948
and 13949
the 13950
monkeys 13951
tried 13952
to 13953
imitate; 13954
but 13955
in 13956
a 13957
very 13958
few 13959
minutes 13960
they 13961
lost 13962
interest 13963
and 13964
began 13965
to 13966
pull 13967
their 13968
friends’ 13969
tails 13970
or 13971
jump 13972
up 13973
and 13974
down 13975
on 13976
all 13977
fours, 13978
coughing. 13979
 13980
“I 13981
wish 13982
to 13983
eat,” 13984
said 13985
Mowgli. 13986
“I 13987
am 13988
a 13989
stranger 13990
in 13991
this 13992
part 13993
of 13994
the 13995
jungle. 13996
Bring 13997
me 13998
food, 13999
or 14000
give 14001
me 14002
leave 14003
to 14004
hunt 14005
here.” 14006
 14007
Twenty 14008
or 14009
thirty 14010
monkeys 14011
bounded 14012
away 14013
to 14014
bring 14015
him 14016
nuts 14017
and 14018
wild 14019
pawpaws. 14020
But 14021
they 14022
fell 14023
to 14024
fighting 14025
on 14026
the 14027
road, 14028
and 14029
it 14030
was 14031
too 14032
much 14033
trouble 14034
to 14035
go 14036
back 14037
with 14038
what 14039
was 14040
left 14041
of 14042
the 14043
fruit. 14044
Mowgli 14045
was 14046
sore 14047
and 14048
angry 14049
as 14050
well 14051
as 14052
hungry, 14053
and 14054
he 14055
roamed 14056
through 14057
the 14058
empty 14059
city 14060
giving 14061
the 14062
Strangers’ 14063
Hunting 14064
Call 14065
from 14066
time 14067
to 14068
time, 14069
but 14070
no 14071
one 14072
answered 14073
him, 14074
and 14075
Mowgli 14076
felt 14077
that 14078
he 14079
had 14080
reached 14081
a 14082
very 14083
bad 14084
place 14085
indeed. 14086
“All 14087
that 14088
Baloo 14089
has 14090
said 14091
about 14092
the 14093
Bandar-log 14094
is 14095
true,” 14096
he 14097
thought 14098
to 14099
himself. 14100
“They 14101
have 14102
no 14103
Law, 14104
no 14105
Hunting 14106
Call, 14107
and 14108
no 14109
leaders--nothing 14110
but 14111
foolish 14112
words 14113
and 14114
little 14115
picking 14116
thievish 14117
hands. 14118
So 14119
if 14120
I 14121
am 14122
starved 14123
or 14124
killed 14125
here, 14126
it 14127
will 14128
be 14129
all 14130
my 14131
own 14132
fault. 14133
But 14134
I 14135
must 14136
try 14137
to 14138
return 14139
to 14140
my 14141
own 14142
jungle. 14143
Baloo 14144
will 14145
surely 14146
beat 14147
me, 14148
but 14149
that 14150
is 14151
better 14152
than 14153
chasing 14154
silly 14155
rose 14156
leaves 14157
with 14158
the 14159
Bandar-log.” 14160
 14161
No 14162
sooner 14163
had 14164
he 14165
walked 14166
to 14167
the 14168
city 14169
wall 14170
than 14171
the 14172
monkeys 14173
pulled 14174
him 14175
back, 14176
telling 14177
him 14178
that 14179
he 14180
did 14181
not 14182
know 14183
how 14184
happy 14185
he 14186
was, 14187
and 14188
pinching 14189
him 14190
to 14191
make 14192
him 14193
grateful. 14194
He 14195
set 14196
his 14197
teeth 14198
and 14199
said 14200
nothing, 14201
but 14202
went 14203
with 14204
the 14205
shouting 14206
monkeys 14207
to 14208
a 14209
terrace 14210
above 14211
the 14212
red 14213
sandstone 14214
reservoirs 14215
that 14216
were 14217
half-full 14218
of 14219
rain 14220
water. 14221
There 14222
was 14223
a 14224
ruined 14225
summer-house 14226
of 14227
white 14228
marble 14229
in 14230
the 14231
center 14232
of 14233
the 14234
terrace, 14235
built 14236
for 14237
queens 14238
dead 14239
a 14240
hundred 14241
years 14242
ago. 14243
The 14244
domed 14245
roof 14246
had 14247
half 14248
fallen 14249
in 14250
and 14251
blocked 14252
up 14253
the 14254
underground 14255
passage 14256
from 14257
the 14258
palace 14259
by 14260
which 14261
the 14262
queens 14263
used 14264
to 14265
enter. 14266
But 14267
the 14268
walls 14269
were 14270
made 14271
of 14272
screens 14273
of 14274
marble 14275
tracery--beautiful 14276
milk-white 14277
fretwork, 14278
set 14279
with 14280
agates 14281
and 14282
cornelians 14283
and 14284
jasper 14285
and 14286
lapis 14287
lazuli, 14288
and 14289
as 14290
the 14291
moon 14292
came 14293
up 14294
behind 14295
the 14296
hill 14297
it 14298
shone 14299
through 14300
the 14301
open 14302
work, 14303
casting 14304
shadows 14305
on 14306
the 14307
ground 14308
like 14309
black 14310
velvet 14311
embroidery. 14312
Sore, 14313
sleepy, 14314
and 14315
hungry 14316
as 14317
he 14318
was, 14319
Mowgli 14320
could 14321
not 14322
help 14323
laughing 14324
when 14325
the 14326
Bandar-log 14327
began, 14328
twenty 14329
at 14330
a 14331
time, 14332
to 14333
tell 14334
him 14335
how 14336
great 14337
and 14338
wise 14339
and 14340
strong 14341
and 14342
gentle 14343
they 14344
were, 14345
and 14346
how 14347
foolish 14348
he 14349
was 14350
to 14351
wish 14352
to 14353
leave 14354
them. 14355
“We 14356
are 14357
great. 14358
We 14359
are 14360
free. 14361
We 14362
are 14363
wonderful. 14364
We 14365
are 14366
the 14367
most 14368
wonderful 14369
people 14370
in 14371
all 14372
the 14373
jungle! 14374
We 14375
all 14376
say 14377
so, 14378
and 14379
so 14380
it 14381
must 14382
be 14383
true,” 14384
they 14385
shouted. 14386
“Now 14387
as 14388
you 14389
are 14390
a 14391
new 14392
listener 14393
and 14394
can 14395
carry 14396
our 14397
words 14398
back 14399
to 14400
the 14401
Jungle-People 14402
so 14403
that 14404
they 14405
may 14406
notice 14407
us 14408
in 14409
future, 14410
we 14411
will 14412
tell 14413
you 14414
all 14415
about 14416
our 14417
most 14418
excellent 14419
selves.” 14420
Mowgli 14421
made 14422
no 14423
objection, 14424
and 14425
the 14426
monkeys 14427
gathered 14428
by 14429
hundreds 14430
and 14431
hundreds 14432
on 14433
the 14434
terrace 14435
to 14436
listen 14437
to 14438
their 14439
own 14440
speakers 14441
singing 14442
the 14443
praises 14444
of 14445
the 14446
Bandar-log, 14447
and 14448
whenever 14449
a 14450
speaker 14451
stopped 14452
for 14453
want 14454
of 14455
breath 14456
they 14457
would 14458
all 14459
shout 14460
together: 14461
“This 14462
is 14463
true; 14464
we 14465
all 14466
say 14467
so.” 14468
Mowgli 14469
nodded 14470
and 14471
blinked, 14472
and 14473
said 14474
“Yes” 14475
when 14476
they 14477
asked 14478
him 14479
a 14480
question, 14481
and 14482
his 14483
head 14484
spun 14485
with 14486
the 14487
noise. 14488
“Tabaqui 14489
the 14490
Jackal 14491
must 14492
have 14493
bitten 14494
all 14495
these 14496
people,” 14497
he 14498
said 14499
to 14500
himself, 14501
“and 14502
now 14503
they 14504
have 14505
madness. 14506
Certainly 14507
this 14508
is 14509
_dewanee_, 14510
the 14511
madness. 14512
Do 14513
they 14514
never 14515
go 14516
to 14517
sleep? 14518
Now 14519
there 14520
is 14521
a 14522
cloud 14523
coming 14524
to 14525
cover 14526
that 14527
moon. 14528
If 14529
it 14530
were 14531
only 14532
a 14533
big 14534
enough 14535
cloud 14536
I 14537
might 14538
try 14539
to 14540
run 14541
away 14542
in 14543
the 14544
darkness. 14545
But 14546
I 14547
am 14548
tired.” 14549
 14550
That 14551
same 14552
cloud 14553
was 14554
being 14555
watched 14556
by 14557
two 14558
good 14559
friends 14560
in 14561
the 14562
ruined 14563
ditch 14564
below 14565
the 14566
city 14567
wall, 14568
for 14569
Bagheera 14570
and 14571
Kaa, 14572
knowing 14573
well 14574
how 14575
dangerous 14576
the 14577
Monkey-People 14578
were 14579
in 14580
large 14581
numbers, 14582
did 14583
not 14584
wish 14585
to 14586
run 14587
any 14588
risks. 14589
The 14590
monkeys 14591
never 14592
fight 14593
unless 14594
they 14595
are 14596
a 14597
hundred 14598
to 14599
one, 14600
and 14601
few 14602
in 14603
the 14604
jungle 14605
care 14606
for 14607
those 14608
odds. 14609
 14610
“I 14611
will 14612
go 14613
to 14614
the 14615
west 14616
wall,” 14617
Kaa 14618
whispered, 14619
“and 14620
come 14621
down 14622
swiftly 14623
with 14624
the 14625
slope 14626
of 14627
the 14628
ground 14629
in 14630
my 14631
favor. 14632
They 14633
will 14634
not 14635
throw 14636
themselves 14637
upon 14638
my 14639
back 14640
in 14641
their 14642
hundreds, 14643
but--” 14644
 14645
“I 14646
know 14647
it,” 14648
said 14649
Bagheera. 14650
“Would 14651
that 14652
Baloo 14653
were 14654
here, 14655
but 14656
we 14657
must 14658
do 14659
what 14660
we 14661
can. 14662
When 14663
that 14664
cloud 14665
covers 14666
the 14667
moon 14668
I 14669
shall 14670
go 14671
to 14672
the 14673
terrace. 14674
They 14675
hold 14676
some 14677
sort 14678
of 14679
council 14680
there 14681
over 14682
the 14683
boy.” 14684
 14685
“Good 14686
hunting,” 14687
said 14688
Kaa 14689
grimly, 14690
and 14691
glided 14692
away 14693
to 14694
the 14695
west 14696
wall. 14697
That 14698
happened 14699
to 14700
be 14701
the 14702
least 14703
ruined 14704
of 14705
any, 14706
and 14707
the 14708
big 14709
snake 14710
was 14711
delayed 14712
awhile 14713
before 14714
he 14715
could 14716
find 14717
a 14718
way 14719
up 14720
the 14721
stones. 14722
The 14723
cloud 14724
hid 14725
the 14726
moon, 14727
and 14728
as 14729
Mowgli 14730
wondered 14731
what 14732
would 14733
come 14734
next 14735
he 14736
heard 14737
Bagheera’s 14738
light 14739
feet 14740
on 14741
the 14742
terrace. 14743
The 14744
Black 14745
Panther 14746
had 14747
raced 14748
up 14749
the 14750
slope 14751
almost 14752
without 14753
a 14754
sound 14755
and 14756
was 14757
striking--he 14758
knew 14759
better 14760
than 14761
to 14762
waste 14763
time 14764
in 14765
biting--right 14766
and 14767
left 14768
among 14769
the 14770
monkeys, 14771
who 14772
were 14773
seated 14774
round 14775
Mowgli 14776
in 14777
circles 14778
fifty 14779
and 14780
sixty 14781
deep. 14782
There 14783
was 14784
a 14785
howl 14786
of 14787
fright 14788
and 14789
rage, 14790
and 14791
then 14792
as 14793
Bagheera 14794
tripped 14795
on 14796
the 14797
rolling 14798
kicking 14799
bodies 14800
beneath 14801
him, 14802
a 14803
monkey 14804
shouted: 14805
“There 14806
is 14807
only 14808
one 14809
here! 14810
Kill 14811
him! 14812
Kill.” 14813
A 14814
scuffling 14815
mass 14816
of 14817
monkeys, 14818
biting, 14819
scratching, 14820
tearing, 14821
and 14822
pulling, 14823
closed 14824
over 14825
Bagheera, 14826
while 14827
five 14828
or 14829
six 14830
laid 14831
hold 14832
of 14833
Mowgli, 14834
dragged 14835
him 14836
up 14837
the 14838
wall 14839
of 14840
the 14841
summerhouse 14842
and 14843
pushed 14844
him 14845
through 14846
the 14847
hole 14848
of 14849
the 14850
broken 14851
dome. 14852
A 14853
man-trained 14854
boy 14855
would 14856
have 14857
been 14858
badly 14859
bruised, 14860
for 14861
the 14862
fall 14863
was 14864
a 14865
good 14866
fifteen 14867
feet, 14868
but 14869
Mowgli 14870
fell 14871
as 14872
Baloo 14873
had 14874
taught 14875
him 14876
to 14877
fall, 14878
and 14879
landed 14880
on 14881
his 14882
feet. 14883
 14884
“Stay 14885
there,” 14886
shouted 14887
the 14888
monkeys, 14889
“till 14890
we 14891
have 14892
killed 14893
thy 14894
friends, 14895
and 14896
later 14897
we 14898
will 14899
play 14900
with 14901
thee--if 14902
the 14903
Poison-People 14904
leave 14905
thee 14906
alive.” 14907
 14908
“We 14909
be 14910
of 14911
one 14912
blood, 14913
ye 14914
and 14915
I,” 14916
said 14917
Mowgli, 14918
quickly 14919
giving 14920
the 14921
Snake’s 14922
Call. 14923
He 14924
could 14925
hear 14926
rustling 14927
and 14928
hissing 14929
in 14930
the 14931
rubbish 14932
all 14933
round 14934
him 14935
and 14936
gave 14937
the 14938
Call 14939
a 14940
second 14941
time, 14942
to 14943
make 14944
sure. 14945
 14946
“Even 14947
ssso! 14948
Down 14949
hoods 14950
all!” 14951
said 14952
half 14953
a 14954
dozen 14955
low 14956
voices 14957
(every 14958
ruin 14959
in 14960
India 14961
becomes 14962
sooner 14963
or 14964
later 14965
a 14966
dwelling 14967
place 14968
of 14969
snakes, 14970
and 14971
the 14972
old 14973
summerhouse 14974
was 14975
alive 14976
with 14977
cobras). 14978
“Stand 14979
still, 14980
Little 14981
Brother, 14982
for 14983
thy 14984
feet 14985
may 14986
do 14987
us 14988
harm.” 14989
 14990
Mowgli 14991
stood 14992
as 14993
quietly 14994
as 14995
he 14996
could, 14997
peering 14998
through 14999
the 15000
open 15001
work 15002
and 15003
listening 15004
to 15005
the 15006
furious 15007
din 15008
of 15009
the 15010
fight 15011
round 15012
the 15013
Black 15014
Panther--the 15015
yells 15016
and 15017
chatterings 15018
and 15019
scufflings, 15020
and 15021
Bagheera’s 15022
deep, 15023
hoarse 15024
cough 15025
as 15026
he 15027
backed 15028
and 15029
bucked 15030
and 15031
twisted 15032
and 15033
plunged 15034
under 15035
the 15036
heaps 15037
of 15038
his 15039
enemies. 15040
For 15041
the 15042
first 15043
time 15044
since 15045
he 15046
was 15047
born, 15048
Bagheera 15049
was 15050
fighting 15051
for 15052
his 15053
life. 15054
 15055
“Baloo 15056
must 15057
be 15058
at 15059
hand; 15060
Bagheera 15061
would 15062
not 15063
have 15064
come 15065
alone,” 15066
Mowgli 15067
thought. 15068
And 15069
then 15070
he 15071
called 15072
aloud: 15073
“To 15074
the 15075
tank, 15076
Bagheera. 15077
Roll 15078
to 15079
the 15080
water 15081
tanks. 15082
Roll 15083
and 15084
plunge! 15085
Get 15086
to 15087
the 15088
water!” 15089
 15090
Bagheera 15091
heard, 15092
and 15093
the 15094
cry 15095
that 15096
told 15097
him 15098
Mowgli 15099
was 15100
safe 15101
gave 15102
him 15103
new 15104
courage. 15105
He 15106
worked 15107
his 15108
way 15109
desperately, 15110
inch 15111
by 15112
inch, 15113
straight 15114
for 15115
the 15116
reservoirs, 15117
halting 15118
in 15119
silence. 15120
Then 15121
from 15122
the 15123
ruined 15124
wall 15125
nearest 15126
the 15127
jungle 15128
rose 15129
up 15130
the 15131
rumbling 15132
war-shout 15133
of 15134
Baloo. 15135
The 15136
old 15137
Bear 15138
had 15139
done 15140
his 15141
best, 15142
but 15143
he 15144
could 15145
not 15146
come 15147
before. 15148
“Bagheera,” 15149
he 15150
shouted, 15151
“I 15152
am 15153
here. 15154
I 15155
climb! 15156
I 15157
haste! 15158
Ahuwora! 15159
The 15160
stones 15161
slip 15162
under 15163
my 15164
feet! 15165
Wait 15166
my 15167
coming, 15168
O 15169
most 15170
infamous 15171
Bandar-log!” 15172
He 15173
panted 15174
up 15175
the 15176
terrace 15177
only 15178
to 15179
disappear 15180
to 15181
the 15182
head 15183
in 15184
a 15185
wave 15186
of 15187
monkeys, 15188
but 15189
he 15190
threw 15191
himself 15192
squarely 15193
on 15194
his 15195
haunches, 15196
and, 15197
spreading 15198
out 15199
his 15200
forepaws, 15201
hugged 15202
as 15203
many 15204
as 15205
he 15206
could 15207
hold, 15208
and 15209
then 15210
began 15211
to 15212
hit 15213
with 15214
a 15215
regular 15216
bat-bat-bat, 15217
like 15218
the 15219
flipping 15220
strokes 15221
of 15222
a 15223
paddle 15224
wheel. 15225
A 15226
crash 15227
and 15228
a 15229
splash 15230
told 15231
Mowgli 15232
that 15233
Bagheera 15234
had 15235
fought 15236
his 15237
way 15238
to 15239
the 15240
tank 15241
where 15242
the 15243
monkeys 15244
could 15245
not 15246
follow. 15247
The 15248
Panther 15249
lay 15250
gasping 15251
for 15252
breath, 15253
his 15254
head 15255
just 15256
out 15257
of 15258
the 15259
water, 15260
while 15261
the 15262
monkeys 15263
stood 15264
three 15265
deep 15266
on 15267
the 15268
red 15269
steps, 15270
dancing 15271
up 15272
and 15273
down 15274
with 15275
rage, 15276
ready 15277
to 15278
spring 15279
upon 15280
him 15281
from 15282
all 15283
sides 15284
if 15285
he 15286
came 15287
out 15288
to 15289
help 15290
Baloo. 15291
It 15292
was 15293
then 15294
that 15295
Bagheera 15296
lifted 15297
up 15298
his 15299
dripping 15300
chin, 15301
and 15302
in 15303
despair 15304
gave 15305
the 15306
Snake’s 15307
Call 15308
for 15309
protection--“We 15310
be 15311
of 15312
one 15313
blood, 15314
ye 15315
and 15316
I”--for 15317
he 15318
believed 15319
that 15320
Kaa 15321
had 15322
turned 15323
tail 15324
at 15325
the 15326
last 15327
minute. 15328
Even 15329
Baloo, 15330
half 15331
smothered 15332
under 15333
the 15334
monkeys 15335
on 15336
the 15337
edge 15338
of 15339
the 15340
terrace, 15341
could 15342
not 15343
help 15344
chuckling 15345
as 15346
he 15347
heard 15348
the 15349
Black 15350
Panther 15351
asking 15352
for 15353
help. 15354
 15355
Kaa 15356
had 15357
only 15358
just 15359
worked 15360
his 15361
way 15362
over 15363
the 15364
west 15365
wall, 15366
landing 15367
with 15368
a 15369
wrench 15370
that 15371
dislodged 15372
a 15373
coping 15374
stone 15375
into 15376
the 15377
ditch. 15378
He 15379
had 15380
no 15381
intention 15382
of 15383
losing 15384
any 15385
advantage 15386
of 15387
the 15388
ground, 15389
and 15390
coiled 15391
and 15392
uncoiled 15393
himself 15394
once 15395
or 15396
twice, 15397
to 15398
be 15399
sure 15400
that 15401
every 15402
foot 15403
of 15404
his 15405
long 15406
body 15407
was 15408
in 15409
working 15410
order. 15411
All 15412
that 15413
while 15414
the 15415
fight 15416
with 15417
Baloo 15418
went 15419
on, 15420
and 15421
the 15422
monkeys 15423
yelled 15424
in 15425
the 15426
tank 15427
round 15428
Bagheera, 15429
and 15430
Mang 15431
the 15432
Bat, 15433
flying 15434
to 15435
and 15436
fro, 15437
carried 15438
the 15439
news 15440
of 15441
the 15442
great 15443
battle 15444
over 15445
the 15446
jungle, 15447
till 15448
even 15449
Hathi 15450
the 15451
Wild 15452
Elephant 15453
trumpeted, 15454
and, 15455
far 15456
away, 15457
scattered 15458
bands 15459
of 15460
the 15461
Monkey-Folk 15462
woke 15463
and 15464
came 15465
leaping 15466
along 15467
the 15468
tree-roads 15469
to 15470
help 15471
their 15472
comrades 15473
in 15474
the 15475
Cold 15476
Lairs, 15477
and 15478
the 15479
noise 15480
of 15481
the 15482
fight 15483
roused 15484
all 15485
the 15486
day 15487
birds 15488
for 15489
miles 15490
round. 15491
Then 15492
Kaa 15493
came 15494
straight, 15495
quickly, 15496
and 15497
anxious 15498
to 15499
kill. 15500
The 15501
fighting 15502
strength 15503
of 15504
a 15505
python 15506
is 15507
in 15508
the 15509
driving 15510
blow 15511
of 15512
his 15513
head 15514
backed 15515
by 15516
all 15517
the 15518
strength 15519
and 15520
weight 15521
of 15522
his 15523
body. 15524
If 15525
you 15526
can 15527
imagine 15528
a 15529
lance, 15530
or 15531
a 15532
battering 15533
ram, 15534
or 15535
a 15536
hammer 15537
weighing 15538
nearly 15539
half 15540
a 15541
ton 15542
driven 15543
by 15544
a 15545
cool, 15546
quiet 15547
mind 15548
living 15549
in 15550
the 15551
handle 15552
of 15553
it, 15554
you 15555
can 15556
roughly 15557
imagine 15558
what 15559
Kaa 15560
was 15561
like 15562
when 15563
he 15564
fought. 15565
A 15566
python 15567
four 15568
or 15569
five 15570
feet 15571
long 15572
can 15573
knock 15574
a 15575
man 15576
down 15577
if 15578
he 15579
hits 15580
him 15581
fairly 15582
in 15583
the 15584
chest, 15585
and 15586
Kaa 15587
was 15588
thirty 15589
feet 15590
long, 15591
as 15592
you 15593
know. 15594
His 15595
first 15596
stroke 15597
was 15598
delivered 15599
into 15600
the 15601
heart 15602
of 15603
the 15604
crowd 15605
round 15606
Baloo. 15607
It 15608
was 15609
sent 15610
home 15611
with 15612
shut 15613
mouth 15614
in 15615
silence, 15616
and 15617
there 15618
was 15619
no 15620
need 15621
of 15622
a 15623
second. 15624
The 15625
monkeys 15626
scattered 15627
with 15628
cries 15629
of--“Kaa! 15630
It 15631
is 15632
Kaa! 15633
Run! 15634
Run!” 15635
 15636
Generations 15637
of 15638
monkeys 15639
had 15640
been 15641
scared 15642
into 15643
good 15644
behavior 15645
by 15646
the 15647
stories 15648
their 15649
elders 15650
told 15651
them 15652
of 15653
Kaa, 15654
the 15655
night 15656
thief, 15657
who 15658
could 15659
slip 15660
along 15661
the 15662
branches 15663
as 15664
quietly 15665
as 15666
moss 15667
grows, 15668
and 15669
steal 15670
away 15671
the 15672
strongest 15673
monkey 15674
that 15675
ever 15676
lived; 15677
of 15678
old 15679
Kaa, 15680
who 15681
could 15682
make 15683
himself 15684
look 15685
so 15686
like 15687
a 15688
dead 15689
branch 15690
or 15691
a 15692
rotten 15693
stump 15694
that 15695
the 15696
wisest 15697
were 15698
deceived, 15699
till 15700
the 15701
branch 15702
caught 15703
them. 15704
Kaa 15705
was 15706
everything 15707
that 15708
the 15709
monkeys 15710
feared 15711
in 15712
the 15713
jungle, 15714
for 15715
none 15716
of 15717
them 15718
knew 15719
the 15720
limits 15721
of 15722
his 15723
power, 15724
none 15725
of 15726
them 15727
could 15728
look 15729
him 15730
in 15731
the 15732
face, 15733
and 15734
none 15735
had 15736
ever 15737
come 15738
alive 15739
out 15740
of 15741
his 15742
hug. 15743
And 15744
so 15745
they 15746
ran, 15747
stammering 15748
with 15749
terror, 15750
to 15751
the 15752
walls 15753
and 15754
the 15755
roofs 15756
of 15757
the 15758
houses, 15759
and 15760
Baloo 15761
drew 15762
a 15763
deep 15764
breath 15765
of 15766
relief. 15767
His 15768
fur 15769
was 15770
much 15771
thicker 15772
than 15773
Bagheera’s, 15774
but 15775
he 15776
had 15777
suffered 15778
sorely 15779
in 15780
the 15781
fight. 15782
Then 15783
Kaa 15784
opened 15785
his 15786
mouth 15787
for 15788
the 15789
first 15790
time 15791
and 15792
spoke 15793
one 15794
long 15795
hissing 15796
word, 15797
and 15798
the 15799
far-away 15800
monkeys, 15801
hurrying 15802
to 15803
the 15804
defense 15805
of 15806
the 15807
Cold 15808
Lairs, 15809
stayed 15810
where 15811
they 15812
were, 15813
cowering, 15814
till 15815
the 15816
loaded 15817
branches 15818
bent 15819
and 15820
crackled 15821
under 15822
them. 15823
The 15824
monkeys 15825
on 15826
the 15827
walls 15828
and 15829
the 15830
empty 15831
houses 15832
stopped 15833
their 15834
cries, 15835
and 15836
in 15837
the 15838
stillness 15839
that 15840
fell 15841
upon 15842
the 15843
city 15844
Mowgli 15845
heard 15846
Bagheera 15847
shaking 15848
his 15849
wet 15850
sides 15851
as 15852
he 15853
came 15854
up 15855
from 15856
the 15857
tank. 15858
Then 15859
the 15860
clamor 15861
broke 15862
out 15863
again. 15864
The 15865
monkeys 15866
leaped 15867
higher 15868
up 15869
the 15870
walls. 15871
They 15872
clung 15873
around 15874
the 15875
necks 15876
of 15877
the 15878
big 15879
stone 15880
idols 15881
and 15882
shrieked 15883
as 15884
they 15885
skipped 15886
along 15887
the 15888
battlements, 15889
while 15890
Mowgli, 15891
dancing 15892
in 15893
the 15894
summerhouse, 15895
put 15896
his 15897
eye 15898
to 15899
the 15900
screenwork 15901
and 15902
hooted 15903
owl-fashion 15904
between 15905
his 15906
front 15907
teeth, 15908
to 15909
show 15910
his 15911
derision 15912
and 15913
contempt. 15914
 15915
“Get 15916
the 15917
man-cub 15918
out 15919
of 15920
that 15921
trap; 15922
I 15923
can 15924
do 15925
no 15926
more,” 15927
Bagheera 15928
gasped. 15929
“Let 15930
us 15931
take 15932
the 15933
man-cub 15934
and 15935
go. 15936
They 15937
may 15938
attack 15939
again.” 15940
 15941
“They 15942
will 15943
not 15944
move 15945
till 15946
I 15947
order 15948
them. 15949
Stay 15950
you 15951
sssso!” 15952
Kaa 15953
hissed, 15954
and 15955
the 15956
city 15957
was 15958
silent 15959
once 15960
more. 15961
“I 15962
could 15963
not 15964
come 15965
before, 15966
Brother, 15967
but 15968
I 15969
think 15970
I 15971
heard 15972
thee 15973
call”--this 15974
was 15975
to 15976
Bagheera. 15977
 15978
“I--I 15979
may 15980
have 15981
cried 15982
out 15983
in 15984
the 15985
battle,” 15986
Bagheera 15987
answered. 15988
“Baloo, 15989
art 15990
thou 15991
hurt? 15992
 15993
“I 15994
am 15995
not 15996
sure 15997
that 15998
they 15999
did 16000
not 16001
pull 16002
me 16003
into 16004
a 16005
hundred 16006
little 16007
bearlings,” 16008
said 16009
Baloo, 16010
gravely 16011
shaking 16012
one 16013
leg 16014
after 16015
the 16016
other. 16017
“Wow! 16018
I 16019
am 16020
sore. 16021
Kaa, 16022
we 16023
owe 16024
thee, 16025
I 16026
think, 16027
our 16028
lives--Bagheera 16029
and 16030
I.” 16031
 16032
“No 16033
matter. 16034
Where 16035
is 16036
the 16037
manling?” 16038
 16039
“Here, 16040
in 16041
a 16042
trap. 16043
I 16044
cannot 16045
climb 16046
out,” 16047
cried 16048
Mowgli. 16049
The 16050
curve 16051
of 16052
the 16053
broken 16054
dome 16055
was 16056
above 16057
his 16058
head. 16059
 16060
“Take 16061
him 16062
away. 16063
He 16064
dances 16065
like 16066
Mao 16067
the 16068
Peacock. 16069
He 16070
will 16071
crush 16072
our 16073
young,” 16074
said 16075
the 16076
cobras 16077
inside. 16078
 16079
“Hah!” 16080
said 16081
Kaa 16082
with 16083
a 16084
chuckle, 16085
“he 16086
has 16087
friends 16088
everywhere, 16089
this 16090
manling. 16091
Stand 16092
back, 16093
manling. 16094
And 16095
hide 16096
you, 16097
O 16098
Poison 16099
People. 16100
I 16101
break 16102
down 16103
the 16104
wall.” 16105
 16106
Kaa 16107
looked 16108
carefully 16109
till 16110
he 16111
found 16112
a 16113
discolored 16114
crack 16115
in 16116
the 16117
marble 16118
tracery 16119
showing 16120
a 16121
weak 16122
spot, 16123
made 16124
two 16125
or 16126
three 16127
light 16128
taps 16129
with 16130
his 16131
head 16132
to 16133
get 16134
the 16135
distance, 16136
and 16137
then 16138
lifting 16139
up 16140
six 16141
feet 16142
of 16143
his 16144
body 16145
clear 16146
of 16147
the 16148
ground, 16149
sent 16150
home 16151
half 16152
a 16153
dozen 16154
full-power 16155
smashing 16156
blows, 16157
nose-first. 16158
The 16159
screen-work 16160
broke 16161
and 16162
fell 16163
away 16164
in 16165
a 16166
cloud 16167
of 16168
dust 16169
and 16170
rubbish, 16171
and 16172
Mowgli 16173
leaped 16174
through 16175
the 16176
opening 16177
and 16178
flung 16179
himself 16180
between 16181
Baloo 16182
and 16183
Bagheera--an 16184
arm 16185
around 16186
each 16187
big 16188
neck. 16189
 16190
“Art 16191
thou 16192
hurt?” 16193
said 16194
Baloo, 16195
hugging 16196
him 16197
softly. 16198
 16199
“I 16200
am 16201
sore, 16202
hungry, 16203
and 16204
not 16205
a 16206
little 16207
bruised. 16208
But, 16209
oh, 16210
they 16211
have 16212
handled 16213
ye 16214
grievously, 16215
my 16216
Brothers! 16217
Ye 16218
bleed.” 16219
 16220
“Others 16221
also,” 16222
said 16223
Bagheera, 16224
licking 16225
his 16226
lips 16227
and 16228
looking 16229
at 16230
the 16231
monkey-dead 16232
on 16233
the 16234
terrace 16235
and 16236
round 16237
the 16238
tank. 16239
 16240
“It 16241
is 16242
nothing, 16243
it 16244
is 16245
nothing, 16246
if 16247
thou 16248
art 16249
safe, 16250
oh, 16251
my 16252
pride 16253
of 16254
all 16255
little 16256
frogs!” 16257
whimpered 16258
Baloo. 16259
 16260
“Of 16261
that 16262
we 16263
shall 16264
judge 16265
later,” 16266
said 16267
Bagheera, 16268
in 16269
a 16270
dry 16271
voice 16272
that 16273
Mowgli 16274
did 16275
not 16276
at 16277
all 16278
like. 16279
“But 16280
here 16281
is 16282
Kaa 16283
to 16284
whom 16285
we 16286
owe 16287
the 16288
battle 16289
and 16290
thou 16291
owest 16292
thy 16293
life. 16294
Thank 16295
him 16296
according 16297
to 16298
our 16299
customs, 16300
Mowgli.” 16301
 16302
Mowgli 16303
turned 16304
and 16305
saw 16306
the 16307
great 16308
Python’s 16309
head 16310
swaying 16311
a 16312
foot 16313
above 16314
his 16315
own. 16316
 16317
“So 16318
this 16319
is 16320
the 16321
manling,” 16322
said 16323
Kaa. 16324
“Very 16325
soft 16326
is 16327
his 16328
skin, 16329
and 16330
he 16331
is 16332
not 16333
unlike 16334
the 16335
Bandar-log. 16336
Have 16337
a 16338
care, 16339
manling, 16340
that 16341
I 16342
do 16343
not 16344
mistake 16345
thee 16346
for 16347
a 16348
monkey 16349
some 16350
twilight 16351
when 16352
I 16353
have 16354
newly 16355
changed 16356
my 16357
coat.” 16358
 16359
“We 16360
be 16361
one 16362
blood, 16363
thou 16364
and 16365
I,” 16366
Mowgli 16367
answered. 16368
“I 16369
take 16370
my 16371
life 16372
from 16373
thee 16374
tonight. 16375
My 16376
kill 16377
shall 16378
be 16379
thy 16380
kill 16381
if 16382
ever 16383
thou 16384
art 16385
hungry, 16386
O 16387
Kaa.” 16388
 16389
“All 16390
thanks, 16391
Little 16392
Brother,” 16393
said 16394
Kaa, 16395
though 16396
his 16397
eyes 16398
twinkled. 16399
“And 16400
what 16401
may 16402
so 16403
bold 16404
a 16405
hunter 16406
kill? 16407
I 16408
ask 16409
that 16410
I 16411
may 16412
follow 16413
when 16414
next 16415
he 16416
goes 16417
abroad.” 16418
 16419
“I 16420
kill 16421
nothing,--I 16422
am 16423
too 16424
little,--but 16425
I 16426
drive 16427
goats 16428
toward 16429
such 16430
as 16431
can 16432
use 16433
them. 16434
When 16435
thou 16436
art 16437
empty 16438
come 16439
to 16440
me 16441
and 16442
see 16443
if 16444
I 16445
speak 16446
the 16447
truth. 16448
I 16449
have 16450
some 16451
skill 16452
in 16453
these 16454
[he 16455
held 16456
out 16457
his 16458
hands], 16459
and 16460
if 16461
ever 16462
thou 16463
art 16464
in 16465
a 16466
trap, 16467
I 16468
may 16469
pay 16470
the 16471
debt 16472
which 16473
I 16474
owe 16475
to 16476
thee, 16477
to 16478
Bagheera, 16479
and 16480
to 16481
Baloo, 16482
here. 16483
Good 16484
hunting 16485
to 16486
ye 16487
all, 16488
my 16489
masters.” 16490
 16491
“Well 16492
said,” 16493
growled 16494
Baloo, 16495
for 16496
Mowgli 16497
had 16498
returned 16499
thanks 16500
very 16501
prettily. 16502
The 16503
Python 16504
dropped 16505
his 16506
head 16507
lightly 16508
for 16509
a 16510
minute 16511
on 16512
Mowgli’s 16513
shoulder. 16514
“A 16515
brave 16516
heart 16517
and 16518
a 16519
courteous 16520
tongue,” 16521
said 16522
he. 16523
“They 16524
shall 16525
carry 16526
thee 16527
far 16528
through 16529
the 16530
jungle, 16531
manling. 16532
But 16533
now 16534
go 16535
hence 16536
quickly 16537
with 16538
thy 16539
friends. 16540
Go 16541
and 16542
sleep, 16543
for 16544
the 16545
moon 16546
sets, 16547
and 16548
what 16549
follows 16550
it 16551
is 16552
not 16553
well 16554
that 16555
thou 16556
shouldst 16557
see.” 16558
 16559
The 16560
moon 16561
was 16562
sinking 16563
behind 16564
the 16565
hills 16566
and 16567
the 16568
lines 16569
of 16570
trembling 16571
monkeys 16572
huddled 16573
together 16574
on 16575
the 16576
walls 16577
and 16578
battlements 16579
looked 16580
like 16581
ragged 16582
shaky 16583
fringes 16584
of 16585
things. 16586
Baloo 16587
went 16588
down 16589
to 16590
the 16591
tank 16592
for 16593
a 16594
drink 16595
and 16596
Bagheera 16597
began 16598
to 16599
put 16600
his 16601
fur 16602
in 16603
order, 16604
as 16605
Kaa 16606
glided 16607
out 16608
into 16609
the 16610
center 16611
of 16612
the 16613
terrace 16614
and 16615
brought 16616
his 16617
jaws 16618
together 16619
with 16620
a 16621
ringing 16622
snap 16623
that 16624
drew 16625
all 16626
the 16627
monkeys’ 16628
eyes 16629
upon 16630
him. 16631
 16632
“The 16633
moon 16634
sets,” 16635
he 16636
said. 16637
“Is 16638
there 16639
yet 16640
light 16641
enough 16642
to 16643
see?” 16644
 16645
From 16646
the 16647
walls 16648
came 16649
a 16650
moan 16651
like 16652
the 16653
wind 16654
in 16655
the 16656
tree-tops--“We 16657
see, 16658
O 16659
Kaa.” 16660
 16661
“Good. 16662
Begins 16663
now 16664
the 16665
dance--the 16666
Dance 16667
of 16668
the 16669
Hunger 16670
of 16671
Kaa. 16672
Sit 16673
still 16674
and 16675
watch.” 16676
 16677
He 16678
turned 16679
twice 16680
or 16681
thrice 16682
in 16683
a 16684
big 16685
circle, 16686
weaving 16687
his 16688
head 16689
from 16690
right 16691
to 16692
left. 16693
Then 16694
he 16695
began 16696
making 16697
loops 16698
and 16699
figures 16700
of 16701
eight 16702
with 16703
his 16704
body, 16705
and 16706
soft, 16707
oozy 16708
triangles 16709
that 16710
melted 16711
into 16712
squares 16713
and 16714
five-sided 16715
figures, 16716
and 16717
coiled 16718
mounds, 16719
never 16720
resting, 16721
never 16722
hurrying, 16723
and 16724
never 16725
stopping 16726
his 16727
low 16728
humming 16729
song. 16730
It 16731
grew 16732
darker 16733
and 16734
darker, 16735
till 16736
at 16737
last 16738
the 16739
dragging, 16740
shifting 16741
coils 16742
disappeared, 16743
but 16744
they 16745
could 16746
hear 16747
the 16748
rustle 16749
of 16750
the 16751
scales. 16752
 16753
Baloo 16754
and 16755
Bagheera 16756
stood 16757
still 16758
as 16759
stone, 16760
growling 16761
in 16762
their 16763
throats, 16764
their 16765
neck 16766
hair 16767
bristling, 16768
and 16769
Mowgli 16770
watched 16771
and 16772
wondered. 16773
 16774
“Bandar-log,” 16775
said 16776
the 16777
voice 16778
of 16779
Kaa 16780
at 16781
last, 16782
“can 16783
ye 16784
stir 16785
foot 16786
or 16787
hand 16788
without 16789
my 16790
order? 16791
Speak!” 16792
 16793
“Without 16794
thy 16795
order 16796
we 16797
cannot 16798
stir 16799
foot 16800
or 16801
hand, 16802
O 16803
Kaa!” 16804
 16805
“Good! 16806
Come 16807
all 16808
one 16809
pace 16810
nearer 16811
to 16812
me.” 16813
 16814
The 16815
lines 16816
of 16817
the 16818
monkeys 16819
swayed 16820
forward 16821
helplessly, 16822
and 16823
Baloo 16824
and 16825
Bagheera 16826
took 16827
one 16828
stiff 16829
step 16830
forward 16831
with 16832
them. 16833
 16834
“Nearer!” 16835
hissed 16836
Kaa, 16837
and 16838
they 16839
all 16840
moved 16841
again. 16842
 16843
Mowgli 16844
laid 16845
his 16846
hands 16847
on 16848
Baloo 16849
and 16850
Bagheera 16851
to 16852
get 16853
them 16854
away, 16855
and 16856
the 16857
two 16858
great 16859
beasts 16860
started 16861
as 16862
though 16863
they 16864
had 16865
been 16866
waked 16867
from 16868
a 16869
dream. 16870
 16871
“Keep 16872
thy 16873
hand 16874
on 16875
my 16876
shoulder,” 16877
Bagheera 16878
whispered. 16879
“Keep 16880
it 16881
there, 16882
or 16883
I 16884
must 16885
go 16886
back--must 16887
go 16888
back 16889
to 16890
Kaa. 16891
Aah!” 16892
 16893
“It 16894
is 16895
only 16896
old 16897
Kaa 16898
making 16899
circles 16900
on 16901
the 16902
dust,” 16903
said 16904
Mowgli. 16905
“Let 16906
us 16907
go.” 16908
And 16909
the 16910
three 16911
slipped 16912
off 16913
through 16914
a 16915
gap 16916
in 16917
the 16918
walls 16919
to 16920
the 16921
jungle. 16922
 16923
“Whoof!” 16924
said 16925
Baloo, 16926
when 16927
he 16928
stood 16929
under 16930
the 16931
still 16932
trees 16933
again. 16934
“Never 16935
more 16936
will 16937
I 16938
make 16939
an 16940
ally 16941
of 16942
Kaa,” 16943
and 16944
he 16945
shook 16946
himself 16947
all 16948
over. 16949
 16950
“He 16951
knows 16952
more 16953
than 16954
we,” 16955
said 16956
Bagheera, 16957
trembling. 16958
“In 16959
a 16960
little 16961
time, 16962
had 16963
I 16964
stayed, 16965
I 16966
should 16967
have 16968
walked 16969
down 16970
his 16971
throat.” 16972
 16973
“Many 16974
will 16975
walk 16976
by 16977
that 16978
road 16979
before 16980
the 16981
moon 16982
rises 16983
again,” 16984
said 16985
Baloo. 16986
“He 16987
will 16988
have 16989
good 16990
hunting--after 16991
his 16992
own 16993
fashion.” 16994
 16995
“But 16996
what 16997
was 16998
the 16999
meaning 17000
of 17001
it 17002
all?” 17003
said 17004
Mowgli, 17005
who 17006
did 17007
not 17008
know 17009
anything 17010
of 17011
a 17012
python’s 17013
powers 17014
of 17015
fascination. 17016
“I 17017
saw 17018
no 17019
more 17020
than 17021
a 17022
big 17023
snake 17024
making 17025
foolish 17026
circles 17027
till 17028
the 17029
dark 17030
came. 17031
And 17032
his 17033
nose 17034
was 17035
all 17036
sore. 17037
Ho! 17038
Ho!” 17039
 17040
“Mowgli,” 17041
said 17042
Bagheera 17043
angrily, 17044
“his 17045
nose 17046
was 17047
sore 17048
on 17049
thy 17050
account, 17051
as 17052
my 17053
ears 17054
and 17055
sides 17056
and 17057
paws, 17058
and 17059
Baloo’s 17060
neck 17061
and 17062
shoulders 17063
are 17064
bitten 17065
on 17066
thy 17067
account. 17068
Neither 17069
Baloo 17070
nor 17071
Bagheera 17072
will 17073
be 17074
able 17075
to 17076
hunt 17077
with 17078
pleasure 17079
for 17080
many 17081
days.” 17082
 17083
“It 17084
is 17085
nothing,” 17086
said 17087
Baloo; 17088
“we 17089
have 17090
the 17091
man-cub 17092
again.” 17093
 17094
“True, 17095
but 17096
he 17097
has 17098
cost 17099
us 17100
heavily 17101
in 17102
time 17103
which 17104
might 17105
have 17106
been 17107
spent 17108
in 17109
good 17110
hunting, 17111
in 17112
wounds, 17113
in 17114
hair--I 17115
am 17116
half 17117
plucked 17118
along 17119
my 17120
back--and 17121
last 17122
of 17123
all, 17124
in 17125
honor. 17126
For, 17127
remember, 17128
Mowgli, 17129
I, 17130
who 17131
am 17132
the 17133
Black 17134
Panther, 17135
was 17136
forced 17137
to 17138
call 17139
upon 17140
Kaa 17141
for 17142
protection, 17143
and 17144
Baloo 17145
and 17146
I 17147
were 17148
both 17149
made 17150
stupid 17151
as 17152
little 17153
birds 17154
by 17155
the 17156
Hunger 17157
Dance. 17158
All 17159
this, 17160
man-cub, 17161
came 17162
of 17163
thy 17164
playing 17165
with 17166
the 17167
Bandar-log.” 17168
 17169
“True, 17170
it 17171
is 17172
true,” 17173
said 17174
Mowgli 17175
sorrowfully. 17176
“I 17177
am 17178
an 17179
evil 17180
man-cub, 17181
and 17182
my 17183
stomach 17184
is 17185
sad 17186
in 17187
me.” 17188
 17189
“Mf! 17190
What 17191
says 17192
the 17193
Law 17194
of 17195
the 17196
Jungle, 17197
Baloo?” 17198
 17199
Baloo 17200
did 17201
not 17202
wish 17203
to 17204
bring 17205
Mowgli 17206
into 17207
any 17208
more 17209
trouble, 17210
but 17211
he 17212
could 17213
not 17214
tamper 17215
with 17216
the 17217
Law, 17218
so 17219
he 17220
mumbled: 17221
“Sorrow 17222
never 17223
stays 17224
punishment. 17225
But 17226
remember, 17227
Bagheera, 17228
he 17229
is 17230
very 17231
little.” 17232
 17233
“I 17234
will 17235
remember. 17236
But 17237
he 17238
has 17239
done 17240
mischief, 17241
and 17242
blows 17243
must 17244
be 17245
dealt 17246
now. 17247
Mowgli, 17248
hast 17249
thou 17250
anything 17251
to 17252
say?” 17253
 17254
“Nothing. 17255
I 17256
did 17257
wrong. 17258
Baloo 17259
and 17260
thou 17261
are 17262
wounded. 17263
It 17264
is 17265
just.” 17266
 17267
Bagheera 17268
gave 17269
him 17270
half 17271
a 17272
dozen 17273
love-taps 17274
from 17275
a 17276
panther’s 17277
point 17278
of 17279
view 17280
(they 17281
would 17282
hardly 17283
have 17284
waked 17285
one 17286
of 17287
his 17288
own 17289
cubs), 17290
but 17291
for 17292
a 17293
seven-year-old 17294
boy 17295
they 17296
amounted 17297
to 17298
as 17299
severe 17300
a 17301
beating 17302
as 17303
you 17304
could 17305
wish 17306
to 17307
avoid. 17308
When 17309
it 17310
was 17311
all 17312
over 17313
Mowgli 17314
sneezed, 17315
and 17316
picked 17317
himself 17318
up 17319
without 17320
a 17321
word. 17322
 17323
“Now,” 17324
said 17325
Bagheera, 17326
“jump 17327
on 17328
my 17329
back, 17330
Little 17331
Brother, 17332
and 17333
we 17334
will 17335
go 17336
home.” 17337
 17338
One 17339
of 17340
the 17341
beauties 17342
of 17343
Jungle 17344
Law 17345
is 17346
that 17347
punishment 17348
settles 17349
all 17350
scores. 17351
There 17352
is 17353
no 17354
nagging 17355
afterward. 17356
 17357
Mowgli 17358
laid 17359
his 17360
head 17361
down 17362
on 17363
Bagheera’s 17364
back 17365
and 17366
slept 17367
so 17368
deeply 17369
that 17370
he 17371
never 17372
waked 17373
when 17374
he 17375
was 17376
put 17377
down 17378
in 17379
the 17380
home-cave. 17381
 17382
 17383
 17384
 17385
Road-Song 17386
of 17387
the 17388
Bandar-Log 17389
 17390
 17391
 17392
 17393
 17394
 17395
Here 17396
we 17397
go 17398
in 17399
a 17400
flung 17401
festoon, 17402
 17403
 17404
 17405
 17406
 17407
Half-way 17408
up 17409
to 17410
the 17411
jealous 17412
moon! 17413
 17414
 17415
 17416
 17417
 17418
Don’t 17419
you 17420
envy 17421
our 17422
pranceful 17423
bands? 17424
 17425
 17426
 17427
 17428
 17429
Don’t 17430
you 17431
wish 17432
you 17433
had 17434
extra 17435
hands? 17436
 17437
 17438
 17439
 17440
 17441
Wouldn’t 17442
you 17443
like 17444
if 17445
your 17446
tails 17447
were--so-- 17448
 17449
 17450
 17451
 17452
 17453
Curved 17454
in 17455
the 17456
shape 17457
of 17458
a 17459
Cupid’s 17460
bow? 17461
 17462
 17463
 17464
 17465
 17466
 17467
 17468
 17469
Now 17470
you’re 17471
angry, 17472
but--never 17473
mind, 17474
 17475
 17476
 17477
 17478
 17479
 17480
 17481
 17482
_Brother, 17483
thy 17484
tail 17485
hangs 17486
down 17487
behind!_ 17488
 17489
 17490
 17491
 17492
 17493
 17494
Here 17495
we 17496
sit 17497
in 17498
a 17499
branchy 17500
row, 17501
 17502
 17503
 17504
 17505
 17506
Thinking 17507
of 17508
beautiful 17509
things 17510
we 17511
know; 17512
 17513
 17514
 17515
 17516
 17517
Dreaming 17518
of 17519
deeds 17520
that 17521
we 17522
mean 17523
to 17524
do, 17525
 17526
 17527
 17528
 17529
 17530
All 17531
complete, 17532
in 17533
a 17534
minute 17535
or 17536
two-- 17537
 17538
 17539
 17540
 17541
 17542
Something 17543
noble 17544
and 17545
wise 17546
and 17547
good, 17548
 17549
 17550
 17551
 17552
 17553
Done 17554
by 17555
merely 17556
wishing 17557
we 17558
could. 17559
 17560
 17561
 17562
 17563
 17564
 17565
 17566
 17567
We’ve 17568
forgotten, 17569
but--never 17570
mind, 17571
 17572
 17573
 17574
 17575
 17576
 17577
 17578
 17579
_Brother, 17580
thy 17581
tail 17582
hangs 17583
down 17584
behind!_ 17585
 17586
 17587
 17588
 17589
 17590
 17591
All 17592
the 17593
talk 17594
we 17595
ever 17596
have 17597
heard 17598
 17599
 17600
 17601
 17602
 17603
Uttered 17604
by 17605
bat 17606
or 17607
beast 17608
or 17609
bird-- 17610
 17611
 17612
 17613
 17614
 17615
Hide 17616
or 17617
fin 17618
or 17619
scale 17620
or 17621
feather-- 17622
 17623
 17624
 17625
 17626
 17627
Jabber 17628
it 17629
quickly 17630
and 17631
all 17632
together! 17633
 17634
 17635
 17636
 17637
 17638
Excellent! 17639
 17640
Wonderful! 17641
 17642
Once 17643
again! 17644
 17645
 17646
 17647
 17648
 17649
 17650
Now 17651
we 17652
are 17653
talking 17654
just 17655
like 17656
men! 17657
 17658
 17659
 17660
 17661
 17662
 17663
 17664
 17665
Let’s 17666
pretend 17667
we 17668
are 17669
... 17670
never 17671
mind, 17672
 17673
 17674
 17675
 17676
 17677
 17678
 17679
 17680
_Brother, 17681
thy 17682
tail 17683
hangs 17684
down 17685
behind!_ 17686
 17687
 17688
 17689
 17690
 17691
 17692
 17693
 17694
This 17695
is 17696
the 17697
way 17698
of 17699
the 17700
Monkey-kind. 17701
 17702
 17703
 17704
 17705
 17706
 17707
_Then 17708
join 17709
our 17710
leaping 17711
lines 17712
that 17713
scumfish 17714
through 17715
the 17716
pines, 17717
 17718
 17719
 17720
 17721
 17722
That 17723
rocket 17724
by 17725
where, 17726
light 17727
and 17728
high, 17729
the 17730
wild 17731
grape 17732
swings. 17733
 17734

By 17739
the 17740

our 17743
wake, 17744
and 17745
the 17746
noble 17747

make, 17750
 17751
 17752
 17753
 17754
 17755
Be 17756
sure, 17757
be 17758
sure, 17759
we’re 17760
going 17761
to 17762
do 17763
some 17764
splendid 17765
things!_ 17766
 17767
 17768
 17769
 17770
“Tiger! 17771
Tiger!” 17772
 17773
 17774
 17775
 17776
 17777
 17778
What 17779
of 17780
the 17781
hunting, 17782
hunter 17783
bold? 17784
 17785
 17786
 17787
 17788
 17789
 17790
 17791
 17792
Brother, 17793
the 17794
watch 17795
was 17796
long 17797
and 17798
cold. 17799
 17800
 17801
 17802
 17803
 17804
What 17805
of 17806
the 17807
quarry 17808
ye 17809
went 17810
to 17811
kill? 17812
 17813
 17814
 17815
 17816
 17817
 17818
 17819
 17820
Brother, 17821
he 17822
crops 17823
in 17824
the 17825
jungle 17826
still. 17827
 17828
 17829
 17830
 17831
 17832
Where 17833
is 17834
the 17835
power 17836
that 17837
made 17838
your 17839
pride? 17840
 17841
 17842
 17843
 17844
 17845
 17846
 17847
 17848
Brother, 17849
it 17850
ebbs 17851
from 17852
my 17853
flank 17854
and 17855
side. 17856
 17857
 17858
 17859
 17860
 17861
Where 17862
is 17863
the 17864
haste 17865
that 17866
ye 17867
hurry 17868
by? 17869
 17870
 17871
 17872
 17873
 17874
 17875
 17876
 17877
Brother, 17878
I 17879
go 17880
to 17881
my 17882
lair--to 17883
die. 17884
 17885
Now 17886
we 17887
must 17888
go 17889
back 17890
to 17891
the 17892
first 17893
tale. 17894
When 17895
Mowgli 17896
left 17897
the 17898
wolf’s 17899
cave 17900
after 17901
the 17902
fight 17903
with 17904
the 17905
Pack 17906
at 17907
the 17908
Council 17909
Rock, 17910
he 17911
went 17912
down 17913
to 17914
the 17915
plowed 17916
lands 17917
where 17918
the 17919
villagers 17920
lived, 17921
but 17922
he 17923
would 17924
not 17925
stop 17926
there 17927
because 17928
it 17929
was 17930
too 17931
near 17932
to 17933
the 17934
jungle, 17935
and 17936
he 17937
knew 17938
that 17939
he 17940
had 17941
made 17942
at 17943
least 17944
one 17945
bad 17946
enemy 17947
at 17948
the 17949
Council. 17950
So 17951
he 17952
hurried 17953
on, 17954
keeping 17955
to 17956
the 17957
rough 17958
road 17959
that 17960
ran 17961
down 17962
the 17963
valley, 17964
and 17965
followed 17966
it 17967
at 17968
a 17969
steady 17970
jog-trot 17971
for 17972
nearly 17973
twenty 17974
miles, 17975
till 17976
he 17977
came 17978
to 17979
a 17980
country 17981
that 17982
he 17983
did 17984
not 17985
know. 17986
The 17987
valley 17988
opened 17989
out 17990
into 17991
a 17992
great 17993
plain 17994
dotted 17995
over 17996
with 17997
rocks 17998
and 17999
cut 18000
up 18001
by 18002
ravines. 18003
At 18004
one 18005
end 18006
stood 18007
a 18008
little 18009
village, 18010
and 18011
at 18012
the 18013
other 18014
the 18015
thick 18016
jungle 18017
came 18018
down 18019
in 18020
a 18021
sweep 18022
to 18023
the 18024
grazing-grounds, 18025
and 18026
stopped 18027
there 18028
as 18029
though 18030
it 18031
had 18032
been 18033
cut 18034
off 18035
with 18036
a 18037
hoe. 18038
All 18039
over 18040
the 18041
plain, 18042
cattle 18043
and 18044
buffaloes 18045
were 18046
grazing, 18047
and 18048
when 18049
the 18050
little 18051
boys 18052
in 18053
charge 18054
of 18055
the 18056
herds 18057
saw 18058
Mowgli 18059
they 18060
shouted 18061
and 18062
ran 18063
away, 18064
and 18065
the 18066
yellow 18067
pariah 18068
dogs 18069
that 18070
hang 18071
about 18072
every 18073
Indian 18074
village 18075
barked. 18076
Mowgli 18077
walked 18078
on, 18079
for 18080
he 18081
was 18082
feeling 18083
hungry, 18084
and 18085
when 18086
he 18087
came 18088
to 18089
the 18090
village 18091
gate 18092
he 18093
saw 18094
the 18095
big 18096
thorn-bush 18097
that 18098
was 18099
drawn 18100
up 18101
before 18102
the 18103
gate 18104
at 18105
twilight, 18106
pushed 18107
to 18108
one 18109
side. 18110
 18111
“Umph!” 18112
he 18113
said, 18114
for 18115
he 18116
had 18117
come 18118
across 18119
more 18120
than 18121
one 18122
such 18123
barricade 18124
in 18125
his 18126
night 18127
rambles 18128
after 18129
things 18130
to 18131
eat. 18132
“So 18133
men 18134
are 18135
afraid 18136
of 18137
the 18138
People 18139
of 18140
the 18141
Jungle 18142
here 18143
also.” 18144
He 18145
sat 18146
down 18147
by 18148
the 18149
gate, 18150
and 18151
when 18152
a 18153
man 18154
came 18155
out 18156
he 18157
stood 18158
up, 18159
opened 18160
his 18161
mouth, 18162
and 18163
pointed 18164
down 18165
it 18166
to 18167
show 18168
that 18169
he 18170
wanted 18171
food. 18172
The 18173
man 18174
stared, 18175
and 18176
ran 18177
back 18178
up 18179
the 18180
one 18181
street 18182
of 18183
the 18184
village 18185
shouting 18186
for 18187
the 18188
priest, 18189
who 18190
was 18191
a 18192
big, 18193
fat 18194
man 18195
dressed 18196
in 18197
white, 18198
with 18199
a 18200
red 18201
and 18202
yellow 18203
mark 18204
on 18205
his 18206
forehead. 18207
The 18208
priest 18209
came 18210
to 18211
the 18212
gate, 18213
and 18214
with 18215
him 18216
at 18217
least 18218
a 18219
hundred 18220
people, 18221
who 18222
stared 18223
and 18224
talked 18225
and 18226
shouted 18227
and 18228
pointed 18229
at 18230
Mowgli. 18231
 18232
“They 18233
have 18234
no 18235
manners, 18236
these 18237
Men 18238
Folk,” 18239
said 18240
Mowgli 18241
to 18242
himself. 18243
“Only 18244
the 18245
gray 18246
ape 18247
would 18248
behave 18249
as 18250
they 18251
do.” 18252
So 18253
he 18254
threw 18255
back 18256
his 18257
long 18258
hair 18259
and 18260
frowned 18261
at 18262
the 18263
crowd. 18264
 18265
“What 18266
is 18267
there 18268
to 18269
be 18270
afraid 18271
of?” 18272
said 18273
the 18274
priest. 18275
“Look 18276
at 18277
the 18278
marks 18279
on 18280
his 18281
arms 18282
and 18283
legs. 18284
They 18285
are 18286
the 18287
bites 18288
of 18289
wolves. 18290
He 18291
is 18292
but 18293
a 18294
wolf-child 18295
run 18296
away 18297
from 18298
the 18299
jungle.” 18300
 18301
Of 18302
course, 18303
in 18304
playing 18305
together, 18306
the 18307
cubs 18308
had 18309
often 18310
nipped 18311
Mowgli 18312
harder 18313
than 18314
they 18315
intended, 18316
and 18317
there 18318
were 18319
white 18320
scars 18321
all 18322
over 18323
his 18324
arms 18325
and 18326
legs. 18327
But 18328
he 18329
would 18330
have 18331
been 18332
the 18333
last 18334
person 18335
in 18336
the 18337
world 18338
to 18339
call 18340
these 18341
bites, 18342
for 18343
he 18344
knew 18345
what 18346
real 18347
biting 18348
meant. 18349
 18350
“Arre! 18351
Arre!” 18352
said 18353
two 18354
or 18355
three 18356
women 18357
together. 18358
“To 18359
be 18360
bitten 18361
by 18362
wolves, 18363
poor 18364
child! 18365
He 18366
is 18367
a 18368
handsome 18369
boy. 18370
He 18371
has 18372
eyes 18373
like 18374
red 18375
fire. 18376
By 18377
my 18378
honor, 18379
Messua, 18380
he 18381
is 18382
not 18383
unlike 18384
thy 18385
boy 18386
that 18387
was 18388
taken 18389
by 18390
the 18391
tiger.” 18392
 18393
“Let 18394
me 18395
look,” 18396
said 18397
a 18398
woman 18399
with 18400
heavy 18401
copper 18402
rings 18403
on 18404
her 18405
wrists 18406
and 18407
ankles, 18408
and 18409
she 18410
peered 18411
at 18412
Mowgli 18413
under 18414
the 18415
palm 18416
of 18417
her 18418
hand. 18419
“Indeed 18420
he 18421
is 18422
not. 18423
He 18424
is 18425
thinner, 18426
but 18427
he 18428
has 18429
the 18430
very 18431
look 18432
of 18433
my 18434
boy.” 18435
 18436
The 18437
priest 18438
was 18439
a 18440
clever 18441
man, 18442
and 18443
he 18444
knew 18445
that 18446
Messua 18447
was 18448
wife 18449
to 18450
the 18451
richest 18452
villager 18453
in 18454
the 18455
place. 18456
So 18457
he 18458
looked 18459
up 18460
at 18461
the 18462
sky 18463
for 18464
a 18465
minute 18466
and 18467
said 18468
solemnly: 18469
“What 18470
the 18471
jungle 18472
has 18473
taken 18474
the 18475
jungle 18476
has 18477
restored. 18478
Take 18479
the 18480
boy 18481
into 18482
thy 18483
house, 18484
my 18485
sister, 18486
and 18487
forget 18488
not 18489
to 18490
honor 18491
the 18492
priest 18493
who 18494
sees 18495
so 18496
far 18497
into 18498
the 18499
lives 18500
of 18501
men.” 18502
 18503
“By 18504
the 18505
Bull 18506
that 18507
bought 18508
me,” 18509
said 18510
Mowgli 18511
to 18512
himself, 18513
“but 18514
all 18515
this 18516
talking 18517
is 18518
like 18519
another 18520
looking-over 18521
by 18522
the 18523
Pack! 18524
Well, 18525
if 18526
I 18527
am 18528
a 18529
man, 18530
a 18531
man 18532
I 18533
must 18534
become.” 18535
 18536
The 18537
crowd 18538
parted 18539
as 18540
the 18541
woman 18542
beckoned 18543
Mowgli 18544
to 18545
her 18546
hut, 18547
where 18548
there 18549
was 18550
a 18551
red 18552
lacquered 18553
bedstead, 18554
a 18555
great 18556
earthen 18557
grain 18558
chest 18559
with 18560
funny 18561
raised 18562
patterns 18563
on 18564
it, 18565
half 18566
a 18567
dozen 18568
copper 18569
cooking 18570
pots, 18571
an 18572
image 18573
of 18574
a 18575
Hindu 18576
god 18577
in 18578
a 18579
little 18580
alcove, 18581
and 18582
on 18583
the 18584
wall 18585
a 18586
real 18587
looking 18588
glass, 18589
such 18590
as 18591
they 18592
sell 18593
at 18594
the 18595
country 18596
fairs. 18597
 18598
She 18599
gave 18600
him 18601
a 18602
long 18603
drink 18604
of 18605
milk 18606
and 18607
some 18608
bread, 18609
and 18610
then 18611
she 18612
laid 18613
her 18614
hand 18615
on 18616
his 18617
head 18618
and 18619
looked 18620
into 18621
his 18622
eyes; 18623
for 18624
she 18625
thought 18626
perhaps 18627
that 18628
he 18629
might 18630
be 18631
her 18632
real 18633
son 18634
come 18635
back 18636
from 18637
the 18638
jungle 18639
where 18640
the 18641
tiger 18642
had 18643
taken 18644
him. 18645
So 18646
she 18647
said, 18648
“Nathoo, 18649
O 18650
Nathoo!” 18651
Mowgli 18652
did 18653
not 18654
show 18655
that 18656
he 18657
knew 18658
the 18659
name. 18660
“Dost 18661
thou 18662
not 18663
remember 18664
the 18665
day 18666
when 18667
I 18668
gave 18669
thee 18670
thy 18671
new 18672
shoes?” 18673
She 18674
touched 18675
his 18676
foot, 18677
and 18678
it 18679
was 18680
almost 18681
as 18682
hard 18683
as 18684
horn. 18685
“No,” 18686
 18687
she 18688
said 18689
sorrowfully, 18690
“those 18691
feet 18692
have 18693
never 18694
worn 18695
shoes, 18696
but 18697
thou 18698
art 18699
very 18700
like 18701
my 18702
Nathoo, 18703
and 18704
thou 18705
shalt 18706
be 18707
my 18708
son.” 18709
 18710
Mowgli 18711
was 18712
uneasy, 18713
because 18714
he 18715
had 18716
never 18717
been 18718
under 18719
a 18720
roof 18721
before. 18722
But 18723
as 18724
he 18725
looked 18726
at 18727
the 18728
thatch, 18729
he 18730
saw 18731
that 18732
he 18733
could 18734
tear 18735
it 18736
out 18737
any 18738
time 18739
if 18740
he 18741
wanted 18742
to 18743
get 18744
away, 18745
and 18746
that 18747
the 18748
window 18749
had 18750
no 18751
fastenings. 18752
“What 18753
is 18754
the 18755
good 18756
of 18757
a 18758
man,” 18759
he 18760
said 18761
to 18762
himself 18763
at 18764
last, 18765
“if 18766
he 18767
does 18768
not 18769
understand 18770
man’s 18771
talk? 18772
Now 18773
I 18774
am 18775
as 18776
silly 18777
and 18778
dumb 18779
as 18780
a 18781
man 18782
would 18783
be 18784
with 18785
us 18786
in 18787
the 18788
jungle. 18789
I 18790
must 18791
speak 18792
their 18793
talk.” 18794
 18795
It 18796
was 18797
not 18798
for 18799
fun 18800
that 18801
he 18802
had 18803
learned 18804
while 18805
he 18806
was 18807
with 18808
the 18809
wolves 18810
to 18811
imitate 18812
the 18813
challenge 18814
of 18815
bucks 18816
in 18817
the 18818
jungle 18819
and 18820
the 18821
grunt 18822
of 18823
the 18824
little 18825
wild 18826
pig. 18827
So, 18828
as 18829
soon 18830
as 18831
Messua 18832
pronounced 18833
a 18834
word 18835
Mowgli 18836
would 18837
imitate 18838
it 18839
almost 18840
perfectly, 18841
and 18842
before 18843
dark 18844
he 18845
had 18846
learned 18847
the 18848
names 18849
of 18850
many 18851
things 18852
in 18853
the 18854
hut. 18855
 18856
There 18857
was 18858
a 18859
difficulty 18860
at 18861
bedtime, 18862
because 18863
Mowgli 18864
would 18865
not 18866
sleep 18867
under 18868
anything 18869
that 18870
looked 18871
so 18872
like 18873
a 18874
panther 18875
trap 18876
as 18877
that 18878
hut, 18879
and 18880
when 18881
they 18882
shut 18883
the 18884
door 18885
he 18886
went 18887
through 18888
the 18889
window. 18890
“Give 18891
him 18892
his 18893
will,” 18894
said 18895
Messua’s 18896
husband. 18897
“Remember 18898
he 18899
can 18900
never 18901
till 18902
now 18903
have 18904
slept 18905
on 18906
a 18907
bed. 18908
If 18909
he 18910
is 18911
indeed 18912
sent 18913
in 18914
the 18915
place 18916
of 18917
our 18918
son 18919
he 18920
will 18921
not 18922
run 18923
away.” 18924
 18925
So 18926
Mowgli 18927
stretched 18928
himself 18929
in 18930
some 18931
long, 18932
clean 18933
grass 18934
at 18935
the 18936
edge 18937
of 18938
the 18939
field, 18940
but 18941
before 18942
he 18943
had 18944
closed 18945
his 18946
eyes 18947
a 18948
soft 18949
gray 18950
nose 18951
poked 18952
him 18953
under 18954
the 18955
chin. 18956
 18957
“Phew!” 18958
said 18959
Gray 18960
Brother 18961
(he 18962
was 18963
the 18964
eldest 18965
of 18966
Mother 18967
Wolf’s 18968
cubs). 18969
“This 18970
is 18971
a 18972
poor 18973
reward 18974
for 18975
following 18976
thee 18977
twenty 18978
miles. 18979
Thou 18980
smellest 18981
of 18982
wood 18983
smoke 18984
and 18985
cattle--altogether 18986
like 18987
a 18988
man 18989
already. 18990
Wake, 18991
Little 18992
Brother; 18993
I 18994
bring 18995
news.” 18996
 18997
“Are 18998
all 18999
well 19000
in 19001
the 19002
jungle?” 19003
said 19004
Mowgli, 19005
hugging 19006
him. 19007
 19008
“All 19009
except 19010
the 19011
wolves 19012
that 19013
were 19014
burned 19015
with 19016
the 19017
Red 19018
Flower. 19019
Now, 19020
listen. 19021
Shere 19022
Khan 19023
has 19024
gone 19025
away 19026
to 19027
hunt 19028
far 19029
off 19030
till 19031
his 19032
coat 19033
grows 19034
again, 19035
for 19036
he 19037
is 19038
badly 19039
singed. 19040
When 19041
he 19042
returns 19043
he 19044
swears 19045
that 19046
he 19047
will 19048
lay 19049
thy 19050
bones 19051
in 19052
the 19053
Waingunga.” 19054
 19055
“There 19056
are 19057
two 19058
words 19059
to 19060
that. 19061
I 19062
also 19063
have 19064
made 19065
a 19066
little 19067
promise. 19068
But 19069
news 19070
is 19071
always 19072
good. 19073
I 19074
am 19075
tired 19076
to-night,--very 19077
tired 19078
with 19079
new 19080
things, 19081
Gray 19082
Brother,--but 19083
bring 19084
me 19085
the 19086
news 19087
always.” 19088
 19089
“Thou 19090
wilt 19091
not 19092
forget 19093
that 19094
thou 19095
art 19096
a 19097
wolf? 19098
Men 19099
will 19100
not 19101
make 19102
thee 19103
forget?” 19104
said 19105
Gray 19106
Brother 19107
anxiously. 19108
 19109
“Never. 19110
I 19111
will 19112
always 19113
remember 19114
that 19115
I 19116
love 19117
thee 19118
and 19119
all 19120
in 19121
our 19122
cave. 19123
But 19124
also 19125
I 19126
will 19127
always 19128
remember 19129
that 19130
I 19131
have 19132
been 19133
cast 19134
out 19135
of 19136
the 19137
Pack.” 19138
 19139
“And 19140
that 19141
thou 19142
mayest 19143
be 19144
cast 19145
out 19146
of 19147
another 19148
pack. 19149
Men 19150
are 19151
only 19152
men, 19153
Little 19154
Brother, 19155
and 19156
their 19157
talk 19158
is 19159
like 19160
the 19161
talk 19162
of 19163
frogs 19164
in 19165
a 19166
pond. 19167
When 19168
I 19169
come 19170
down 19171
here 19172
again, 19173
I 19174
will 19175
wait 19176
for 19177
thee 19178
in 19179
the 19180
bamboos 19181
at 19182
the 19183
edge 19184
of 19185
the 19186
grazing-ground.” 19187
 19188
For 19189
three 19190
months 19191
after 19192
that 19193
night 19194
Mowgli 19195
hardly 19196
ever 19197
left 19198
the 19199
village 19200
gate, 19201
he 19202
was 19203
so 19204
busy 19205
learning 19206
the 19207
ways 19208
and 19209
customs 19210
of 19211
men. 19212
First 19213
he 19214
had 19215
to 19216
wear 19217
a 19218
cloth 19219
round 19220
him, 19221
which 19222
annoyed 19223
him 19224
horribly; 19225
and 19226
then 19227
he 19228
had 19229
to 19230
learn 19231
about 19232
money, 19233
which 19234
he 19235
did 19236
not 19237
in 19238
the 19239
least 19240
understand, 19241
and 19242
about 19243
plowing, 19244
of 19245
which 19246
he 19247
did 19248
not 19249
see 19250
the 19251
use. 19252
Then 19253
the 19254
little 19255
children 19256
in 19257
the 19258
village 19259
made 19260
him 19261
very 19262
angry. 19263
Luckily, 19264
the 19265
Law 19266
of 19267
the 19268
Jungle 19269
had 19270
taught 19271
him 19272
to 19273
keep 19274
his 19275
temper, 19276
for 19277
in 19278
the 19279
jungle 19280
life 19281
and 19282
food 19283
depend 19284
on 19285
keeping 19286
your 19287
temper; 19288
but 19289
when 19290
they 19291
made 19292
fun 19293
of 19294
him 19295
because 19296
he 19297
would 19298
not 19299
play 19300
games 19301
or 19302
fly 19303
kites, 19304
or 19305
because 19306
he 19307
mispronounced 19308
some 19309
word, 19310
only 19311
the 19312
knowledge 19313
that 19314
it 19315
was 19316
unsportsmanlike 19317
to 19318
kill 19319
little 19320
naked 19321
cubs 19322
kept 19323
him 19324
from 19325
picking 19326
them 19327
up 19328
and 19329
breaking 19330
them 19331
in 19332
two. 19333
 19334
He 19335
did 19336
not 19337
know 19338
his 19339
own 19340
strength 19341
in 19342
the 19343
least. 19344
In 19345
the 19346
jungle 19347
he 19348
knew 19349
he 19350
was 19351
weak 19352
compared 19353
with 19354
the 19355
beasts, 19356
but 19357
in 19358
the 19359
village 19360
people 19361
said 19362
that 19363
he 19364
was 19365
as 19366
strong 19367
as 19368
a 19369
bull. 19370
 19371
And 19372
Mowgli 19373
had 19374
not 19375
the 19376
faintest 19377
idea 19378
of 19379
the 19380
difference 19381
that 19382
caste 19383
makes 19384
between 19385
man 19386
and 19387
man. 19388
When 19389
the 19390
potter’s 19391
donkey 19392
slipped 19393
in 19394
the 19395
clay 19396
pit, 19397
Mowgli 19398
hauled 19399
it 19400
out 19401
by 19402
the 19403
tail, 19404
and 19405
helped 19406
to 19407
stack 19408
the 19409
pots 19410
for 19411
their 19412
journey 19413
to 19414
the 19415
market 19416
at 19417
Khanhiwara. 19418
That 19419
was 19420
very 19421
shocking, 19422
too, 19423
for 19424
the 19425
potter 19426
is 19427
a 19428
low-caste 19429
man, 19430
and 19431
his 19432
donkey 19433
is 19434
worse. 19435
When 19436
the 19437
priest 19438
scolded 19439
him, 19440
Mowgli 19441
threatened 19442
to 19443
put 19444
him 19445
on 19446
the 19447
donkey 19448
too, 19449
and 19450
the 19451
priest 19452
told 19453
Messua’s 19454
husband 19455
that 19456
Mowgli 19457
had 19458
better 19459
be 19460
set 19461
to 19462
work 19463
as 19464
soon 19465
as 19466
possible; 19467
and 19468
the 19469
village 19470
head-man 19471
told 19472
Mowgli 19473
that 19474
he 19475
would 19476
have 19477
to 19478
go 19479
out 19480
with 19481
the 19482
buffaloes 19483
next 19484
day, 19485
and 19486
herd 19487
them 19488
while 19489
they 19490
grazed. 19491
No 19492
one 19493
was 19494
more 19495
pleased 19496
than 19497
Mowgli; 19498
and 19499
that 19500
night, 19501
because 19502
he 19503
had 19504
been 19505
appointed 19506
a 19507
servant 19508
of 19509
the 19510
village, 19511
as 19512
it 19513
were, 19514
he 19515
went 19516
off 19517
to 19518
a 19519
circle 19520
that 19521
met 19522
every 19523
evening 19524
on 19525
a 19526
masonry 19527
platform 19528
under 19529
a 19530
great 19531
fig-tree. 19532
It 19533
was 19534
the 19535
village 19536
club, 19537
and 19538
the 19539
head-man 19540
and 19541
the 19542
watchman 19543
and 19544
the 19545
barber, 19546
who 19547
knew 19548
all 19549
the 19550
gossip 19551
of 19552
the 19553
village, 19554
and 19555
old 19556
Buldeo, 19557
the 19558
village 19559
hunter, 19560
who 19561
had 19562
a 19563
Tower 19564
musket, 19565
met 19566
and 19567
smoked. 19568
The 19569
monkeys 19570
sat 19571
and 19572
talked 19573
in 19574
the 19575
upper 19576
branches, 19577
and 19578
there 19579
was 19580
a 19581
hole 19582
under 19583
the 19584
platform 19585
where 19586
a 19587
cobra 19588
lived, 19589
and 19590
he 19591
had 19592
his 19593
little 19594
platter 19595
of 19596
milk 19597
every 19598
night 19599
because 19600
he 19601
was 19602
sacred; 19603
and 19604
the 19605
old 19606
men 19607
sat 19608
around 19609
the 19610
tree 19611
and 19612
talked, 19613
and 19614
pulled 19615
at 19616
the 19617
big 19618
huqas 19619
(the 19620
water-pipes) 19621
till 19622
far 19623
into 19624
the 19625
night. 19626
They 19627
told 19628
wonderful 19629
tales 19630
of 19631
gods 19632
and 19633
men 19634
and 19635
ghosts; 19636
and 19637
Buldeo 19638
told 19639
even 19640
more 19641
wonderful 19642
ones 19643
of 19644
the 19645
ways 19646
of 19647
beasts 19648
in 19649
the 19650
jungle, 19651
till 19652
the 19653
eyes 19654
of 19655
the 19656
children 19657
sitting 19658
outside 19659
the 19660
circle 19661
bulged 19662
out 19663
of 19664
their 19665
heads. 19666
Most 19667
of 19668
the 19669
tales 19670
were 19671
about 19672
animals, 19673
for 19674
the 19675
jungle 19676
was 19677
always 19678
at 19679
their 19680
door. 19681
The 19682
deer 19683
and 19684
the 19685
wild 19686
pig 19687
grubbed 19688
up 19689
their 19690
crops, 19691
and 19692
now 19693
and 19694
again 19695
the 19696
tiger 19697
carried 19698
off 19699
a 19700
man 19701
at 19702
twilight, 19703
within 19704
sight 19705
of 19706
the 19707
village 19708
gates. 19709
 19710
Mowgli, 19711
who 19712
naturally 19713
knew 19714
something 19715
about 19716
what 19717
they 19718
were 19719
talking 19720
of, 19721
had 19722
to 19723
cover 19724
his 19725
face 19726
not 19727
to 19728
show 19729
that 19730
he 19731
was 19732
laughing, 19733
while 19734
Buldeo, 19735
the 19736
Tower 19737
musket 19738
across 19739
his 19740
knees, 19741
climbed 19742
on 19743
from 19744
one 19745
wonderful 19746
story 19747
to 19748
another, 19749
and 19750
Mowgli’s 19751
shoulders 19752
shook. 19753
 19754
Buldeo 19755
was 19756
explaining 19757
how 19758
the 19759
tiger 19760
that 19761
had 19762
carried 19763
away 19764
Messua’s 19765
son 19766
was 19767
a 19768
ghost-tiger, 19769
and 19770
his 19771
body 19772
was 19773
inhabited 19774
by 19775
the 19776
ghost 19777
of 19778
a 19779
wicked, 19780
old 19781
money-lender, 19782
who 19783
had 19784
died 19785
some 19786
years 19787
ago. 19788
“And 19789
I 19790
know 19791
that 19792
this 19793
is 19794
true,” 19795
he 19796
said, 19797
“because 19798
Purun 19799
Dass 19800
always 19801
limped 19802
from 19803
the 19804
blow 19805
that 19806
he 19807
got 19808
in 19809
a 19810
riot 19811
when 19812
his 19813
account 19814
books 19815
were 19816
burned, 19817
and 19818
the 19819
tiger 19820
that 19821
I 19822
speak 19823
of 19824
he 19825
limps, 19826
too, 19827
for 19828
the 19829
tracks 19830
of 19831
his 19832
pads 19833
are 19834
unequal.” 19835
 19836
“True, 19837
true, 19838
that 19839
must 19840
be 19841
the 19842
truth,” 19843
said 19844
the 19845
gray-beards, 19846
nodding 19847
together. 19848
 19849
“Are 19850
all 19851
these 19852
tales 19853
such 19854
cobwebs 19855
and 19856
moontalk?” 19857
said 19858
Mowgli. 19859
“That 19860
tiger 19861
limps 19862
because 19863
he 19864
was 19865
born 19866
lame, 19867
as 19868
everyone 19869
knows. 19870
To 19871
talk 19872
of 19873
the 19874
soul 19875
of 19876
a 19877
money-lender 19878
in 19879
a 19880
beast 19881
that 19882
never 19883
had 19884
the 19885
courage 19886
of 19887
a 19888
jackal 19889
is 19890
child’s 19891
talk.” 19892
 19893
Buldeo 19894
was 19895
speechless 19896
with 19897
surprise 19898
for 19899
a 19900
moment, 19901
and 19902
the 19903
head-man 19904
stared. 19905
 19906
“Oho! 19907
It 19908
is 19909
the 19910
jungle 19911
brat, 19912
is 19913
it?” 19914
said 19915
Buldeo. 19916
“If 19917
thou 19918
art 19919
so 19920
wise, 19921
better 19922
bring 19923
his 19924
hide 19925
to 19926
Khanhiwara, 19927
for 19928
the 19929
Government 19930
has 19931
set 19932
a 19933
hundred 19934
rupees 19935
on 19936
his 19937
life. 19938
Better 19939
still, 19940
talk 19941
not 19942
when 19943
thy 19944
elders 19945
speak.” 19946
 19947
Mowgli 19948
rose 19949
to 19950
go. 19951
“All 19952
the 19953
evening 19954
I 19955
have 19956
lain 19957
here 19958
listening,” 19959
he 19960
called 19961
back 19962
over 19963
his 19964
shoulder, 19965
“and, 19966
except 19967
once 19968
or 19969
twice, 19970
Buldeo 19971
has 19972
not 19973
said 19974
one 19975
word 19976
of 19977
truth 19978
concerning 19979
the 19980
jungle, 19981
which 19982
is 19983
at 19984
his 19985
very 19986
doors. 19987
How, 19988
then, 19989
shall 19990
I 19991
believe 19992
the 19993
tales 19994
of 19995
ghosts 19996
and 19997
gods 19998
and 19999
goblins 20000
which 20001
he 20002
says 20003
he 20004
has 20005
seen?” 20006
 20007
“It 20008
is 20009
full 20010
time 20011
that 20012
boy 20013
went 20014
to 20015
herding,” 20016
said 20017
the 20018
head-man, 20019
while 20020
Buldeo 20021
puffed 20022
and 20023
snorted 20024
at 20025
Mowgli’s 20026
impertinence. 20027
 20028
The 20029
custom 20030
of 20031
most 20032
Indian 20033
villages 20034
is 20035
for 20036
a 20037
few 20038
boys 20039
to 20040
take 20041
the 20042
cattle 20043
and 20044
buffaloes 20045
out 20046
to 20047
graze 20048
in 20049
the 20050
early 20051
morning, 20052
and 20053
bring 20054
them 20055
back 20056
at 20057
night. 20058
The 20059
very 20060
cattle 20061
that 20062
would 20063
trample 20064
a 20065
white 20066
man 20067
to 20068
death 20069
allow 20070
themselves 20071
to 20072
be 20073
banged 20074
and 20075
bullied 20076
and 20077
shouted 20078
at 20079
by 20080
children 20081
that 20082
hardly 20083
come 20084
up 20085
to 20086
their 20087
noses. 20088
So 20089
long 20090
as 20091
the 20092
boys 20093
keep 20094
with 20095
the 20096
herds 20097
they 20098
are 20099
safe, 20100
for 20101
not 20102
even 20103
the 20104
tiger 20105
will 20106
charge 20107
a 20108
mob 20109
of 20110
cattle. 20111
But 20112
if 20113
they 20114
straggle 20115
to 20116
pick 20117
flowers 20118
or 20119
hunt 20120
lizards, 20121
they 20122
are 20123
sometimes 20124
carried 20125
off. 20126
Mowgli 20127
went 20128
through 20129
the 20130
village 20131
street 20132
in 20133
the 20134
dawn, 20135
sitting 20136
on 20137
the 20138
back 20139
of 20140
Rama, 20141
the 20142
great 20143
herd 20144
bull. 20145
The 20146
slaty-blue 20147
buffaloes, 20148
with 20149
their 20150
long, 20151
backward-sweeping 20152
horns 20153
and 20154
savage 20155
eyes, 20156
rose 20157
out 20158
their 20159
byres, 20160
one 20161
by 20162
one, 20163
and 20164
followed 20165
him, 20166
and 20167
Mowgli 20168
made 20169
it 20170
very 20171
clear 20172
to 20173
the 20174
children 20175
with 20176
him 20177
that 20178
he 20179
was 20180
the 20181
master. 20182
He 20183
beat 20184
the 20185
buffaloes 20186
with 20187
a 20188
long, 20189
polished 20190
bamboo, 20191
and 20192
told 20193
Kamya, 20194
one 20195
of 20196
the 20197
boys, 20198
to 20199
graze 20200
the 20201
cattle 20202
by 20203
themselves, 20204
while 20205
he 20206
went 20207
on 20208
with 20209
the 20210
buffaloes, 20211
and 20212
to 20213
be 20214
very 20215
careful 20216
not 20217
to 20218
stray 20219
away 20220
from 20221
the 20222
herd. 20223
 20224
An 20225
Indian 20226
grazing 20227
ground 20228
is 20229
all 20230
rocks 20231
and 20232
scrub 20233
and 20234
tussocks 20235
and 20236
little 20237
ravines, 20238
among 20239
which 20240
the 20241
herds 20242
scatter 20243
and 20244
disappear. 20245
The 20246
buffaloes 20247
generally 20248
keep 20249
to 20250
the 20251
pools 20252
and 20253
muddy 20254
places, 20255
where 20256
they 20257
lie 20258
wallowing 20259
or 20260
basking 20261
in 20262
the 20263
warm 20264
mud 20265
for 20266
hours. 20267
Mowgli 20268
drove 20269
them 20270
on 20271
to 20272
the 20273
edge 20274
of 20275
the 20276
plain 20277
where 20278
the 20279
Waingunga 20280
came 20281
out 20282
of 20283
the 20284
jungle; 20285
then 20286
he 20287
dropped 20288
from 20289
Rama’s 20290
neck, 20291
trotted 20292
off 20293
to 20294
a 20295
bamboo 20296
clump, 20297
and 20298
found 20299
Gray 20300
Brother. 20301
“Ah,” 20302
said 20303
Gray 20304
Brother, 20305
“I 20306
have 20307
waited 20308
here 20309
very 20310
many 20311
days. 20312
What 20313
is 20314
the 20315
meaning 20316
of 20317
this 20318
cattle-herding 20319
work?” 20320
 20321
“It 20322
is 20323
an 20324
order,” 20325
said 20326
Mowgli. 20327
“I 20328
am 20329
a 20330
village 20331
herd 20332
for 20333
a 20334
while. 20335
What 20336
news 20337
of 20338
Shere 20339
Khan?” 20340
 20341
“He 20342
has 20343
come 20344
back 20345
to 20346
this 20347
country, 20348
and 20349
has 20350
waited 20351
here 20352
a 20353
long 20354
time 20355
for 20356
thee. 20357
Now 20358
he 20359
has 20360
gone 20361
off 20362
again, 20363
for 20364
the 20365
game 20366
is 20367
scarce. 20368
But 20369
he 20370
means 20371
to 20372
kill 20373
thee.” 20374
 20375
“Very 20376
good,” 20377
said 20378
Mowgli. 20379
“So 20380
long 20381
as 20382
he 20383
is 20384
away 20385
do 20386
thou 20387
or 20388
one 20389
of 20390
the 20391
four 20392
brothers 20393
sit 20394
on 20395
that 20396
rock, 20397
so 20398
that 20399
I 20400
can 20401
see 20402
thee 20403
as 20404
I 20405
come 20406
out 20407
of 20408
the 20409
village. 20410
When 20411
he 20412
comes 20413
back 20414
wait 20415
for 20416
me 20417
in 20418
the 20419
ravine 20420
by 20421
the 20422
_dhâk_ 20423
tree 20424
in 20425
the 20426
center 20427
of 20428
the 20429
plain. 20430
We 20431
need 20432
not 20433
walk 20434
into 20435
Shere 20436
Khan’s 20437
mouth.” 20438
 20439
Then 20440
Mowgli 20441
picked 20442
out 20443
a 20444
shady 20445
place, 20446
and 20447
lay 20448
down 20449
and 20450
slept 20451
while 20452
the 20453
buffaloes 20454
grazed 20455
round 20456
him. 20457
Herding 20458
in 20459
India 20460
is 20461
one 20462
of 20463
the 20464
laziest 20465
things 20466
in 20467
the 20468
world. 20469
The 20470
cattle 20471
move 20472
and 20473
crunch, 20474
and 20475
lie 20476
down, 20477
and 20478
move 20479
on 20480
again, 20481
and 20482
they 20483
do 20484
not 20485
even 20486
low. 20487
They 20488
only 20489
grunt, 20490
and 20491
the 20492
buffaloes 20493
very 20494
seldom 20495
say 20496
anything, 20497
but 20498
get 20499
down 20500
into 20501
the 20502
muddy 20503
pools 20504
one 20505
after 20506
another, 20507
and 20508
work 20509
their 20510
way 20511
into 20512
the 20513
mud 20514
till 20515
only 20516
their 20517
noses 20518
and 20519
staring 20520
china-blue 20521
eyes 20522
show 20523
above 20524
the 20525
surface, 20526
and 20527
then 20528
they 20529
lie 20530
like 20531
logs. 20532
The 20533
sun 20534
makes 20535
the 20536
rocks 20537
dance 20538
in 20539
the 20540
heat, 20541
and 20542
the 20543
herd 20544
children 20545
hear 20546
one 20547
kite 20548
(never 20549
any 20550
more) 20551
whistling 20552
almost 20553
out 20554
of 20555
sight 20556
overhead, 20557
and 20558
they 20559
know 20560
that 20561
if 20562
they 20563
died, 20564
or 20565
a 20566
cow 20567
died, 20568
that 20569
kite 20570
would 20571
sweep 20572
down, 20573
and 20574
the 20575
next 20576
kite 20577
miles 20578
away 20579
would 20580
see 20581
him 20582
drop 20583
and 20584
follow, 20585
and 20586
the 20587
next, 20588
and 20589
the 20590
next, 20591
and 20592
almost 20593
before 20594
they 20595
were 20596
dead 20597
there 20598
would 20599
be 20600
a 20601
score 20602
of 20603
hungry 20604
kites 20605
come 20606
out 20607
of 20608
nowhere. 20609
Then 20610
they 20611
sleep 20612
and 20613
wake 20614
and 20615
sleep 20616
again, 20617
and 20618
weave 20619
little 20620
baskets 20621
of 20622
dried 20623
grass 20624
and 20625
put 20626
grasshoppers 20627
in 20628
them; 20629
or 20630
catch 20631
two 20632
praying 20633
mantises 20634
and 20635
make 20636
them 20637
fight; 20638
or 20639
string 20640
a 20641
necklace 20642
of 20643
red 20644
and 20645
black 20646
jungle 20647
nuts; 20648
or 20649
watch 20650
a 20651
lizard 20652
basking 20653
on 20654
a 20655
rock, 20656
or 20657
a 20658
snake 20659
hunting 20660
a 20661
frog 20662
near 20663
the 20664
wallows. 20665
Then 20666
they 20667
sing 20668
long, 20669
long 20670
songs 20671
with 20672
odd 20673
native 20674
quavers 20675
at 20676
the 20677
end 20678
of 20679
them, 20680
and 20681
the 20682
day 20683
seems 20684
longer 20685
than 20686
most 20687
people’s 20688
whole 20689
lives, 20690
and 20691
perhaps 20692
they 20693
make 20694
a 20695
mud 20696
castle 20697
with 20698
mud 20699
figures 20700
of 20701
men 20702
and 20703
horses 20704
and 20705
buffaloes, 20706
and 20707
put 20708
reeds 20709
into 20710
the 20711
men’s 20712
hands, 20713
and 20714
pretend 20715
that 20716
they 20717
are 20718
kings 20719
and 20720
the 20721
figures 20722
are 20723
their 20724
armies, 20725
or 20726
that 20727
they 20728
are 20729
gods 20730
to 20731
be 20732
worshiped. 20733
Then 20734
evening 20735
comes 20736
and 20737
the 20738
children 20739
call, 20740
and 20741
the 20742
buffaloes 20743
lumber 20744
up 20745
out 20746
of 20747
the 20748
sticky 20749
mud 20750
with 20751
noises 20752
like 20753
gunshots 20754
going 20755
off 20756
one 20757
after 20758
the 20759
other, 20760
and 20761
they 20762
all 20763
string 20764
across 20765
the 20766
gray 20767
plain 20768
back 20769
to 20770
the 20771
twinkling 20772
village 20773
lights. 20774
 20775
Day 20776
after 20777
day 20778
Mowgli 20779
would 20780
lead 20781
the 20782
buffaloes 20783
out 20784
to 20785
their 20786
wallows, 20787
and 20788
day 20789
after 20790
day 20791
he 20792
would 20793
see 20794
Gray 20795
Brother’s 20796
back 20797
a 20798
mile 20799
and 20800
a 20801
half 20802
away 20803
across 20804
the 20805
plain 20806
(so 20807
he 20808
knew 20809
that 20810
Shere 20811
Khan 20812
had 20813
not 20814
come 20815
back), 20816
and 20817
day 20818
after 20819
day 20820
he 20821
would 20822
lie 20823
on 20824
the 20825
grass 20826
listening 20827
to 20828
the 20829
noises 20830
round 20831
him, 20832
and 20833
dreaming 20834
of 20835
old 20836
days 20837
in 20838
the 20839
jungle. 20840
If 20841
Shere 20842
Khan 20843
had 20844
made 20845
a 20846
false 20847
step 20848
with 20849
his 20850
lame 20851
paw 20852
up 20853
in 20854
the 20855
jungles 20856
by 20857
the 20858
Waingunga, 20859
Mowgli 20860
would 20861
have 20862
heard 20863
him 20864
in 20865
those 20866
long, 20867
still 20868
mornings. 20869
 20870
At 20871
last 20872
a 20873
day 20874
came 20875
when 20876
he 20877
did 20878
not 20879
see 20880
Gray 20881
Brother 20882
at 20883
the 20884
signal 20885
place, 20886
and 20887
he 20888
laughed 20889
and 20890
headed 20891
the 20892
buffaloes 20893
for 20894
the 20895
ravine 20896
by 20897
the 20898
dhk 20899
tree, 20900
which 20901
was 20902
all 20903
covered 20904
with 20905
golden-red 20906
flowers. 20907
There 20908
sat 20909
Gray 20910
Brother, 20911
every 20912
bristle 20913
on 20914
his 20915
back 20916
lifted. 20917
 20918
“He 20919
has 20920
hidden 20921
for 20922
a 20923
month 20924
to 20925
throw 20926
thee 20927
off 20928
thy 20929
guard. 20930
He 20931
crossed 20932
the 20933
ranges 20934
last 20935
night 20936
with 20937
Tabaqui, 20938
hot-foot 20939
on 20940
thy 20941
trail,” 20942
said 20943
the 20944
Wolf, 20945
panting. 20946
 20947
Mowgli 20948
frowned. 20949
“I 20950
am 20951
not 20952
afraid 20953
of 20954
Shere 20955
Khan, 20956
but 20957
Tabaqui 20958
is 20959
very 20960
cunning.” 20961
 20962
“Have 20963
no 20964
fear,” 20965
said 20966
Gray 20967
Brother, 20968
licking 20969
his 20970
lips 20971
a 20972
little. 20973
“I 20974
met 20975
Tabaqui 20976
in 20977
the 20978
dawn. 20979
Now 20980
he 20981
is 20982
telling 20983
all 20984
his 20985
wisdom 20986
to 20987
the 20988
kites, 20989
but 20990
he 20991
told 20992
me 20993
everything 20994
before 20995
I 20996
broke 20997
his 20998
back. 20999
Shere 21000
Khan’s 21001
plan 21002
is 21003
to 21004
wait 21005
for 21006
thee 21007
at 21008
the 21009
village 21010
gate 21011
this 21012
evening--for 21013
thee 21014
and 21015
for 21016
no 21017
one 21018
else. 21019
He 21020
is 21021
lying 21022
up 21023
now, 21024
in 21025
the 21026
big 21027
dry 21028
ravine 21029
of 21030
the 21031
Waingunga.” 21032
 21033
“Has 21034
he 21035
eaten 21036
today, 21037
or 21038
does 21039
he 21040
hunt 21041
empty?” 21042
said 21043
Mowgli, 21044
for 21045
the 21046
answer 21047
meant 21048
life 21049
and 21050
death 21051
to 21052
him. 21053
 21054
“He 21055
killed 21056
at 21057
dawn,--a 21058
pig,--and 21059
he 21060
has 21061
drunk 21062
too. 21063
Remember, 21064
Shere 21065
Khan 21066
could 21067
never 21068
fast, 21069
even 21070
for 21071
the 21072
sake 21073
of 21074
revenge.” 21075
 21076
“Oh! 21077
Fool, 21078
fool! 21079
What 21080
a 21081
cub’s 21082
cub 21083
it 21084
is! 21085
Eaten 21086
and 21087
drunk 21088
too, 21089
and 21090
he 21091
thinks 21092
that 21093
I 21094
shall 21095
wait 21096
till 21097
he 21098
has 21099
slept! 21100
Now, 21101
where 21102
does 21103
he 21104
lie 21105
up? 21106
If 21107
there 21108
were 21109
but 21110
ten 21111
of 21112
us 21113
we 21114
might 21115
pull 21116
him 21117
down 21118
as 21119
he 21120
lies. 21121
These 21122
buffaloes 21123
will 21124
not 21125
charge 21126
unless 21127
they 21128
wind 21129
him, 21130
and 21131
I 21132
cannot 21133
speak 21134
their 21135
language. 21136
Can 21137
we 21138
get 21139
behind 21140
his 21141
track 21142
so 21143
that 21144
they 21145
may 21146
smell 21147
it?” 21148
 21149
“He 21150
swam 21151
far 21152
down 21153
the 21154
Waingunga 21155
to 21156
cut 21157
that 21158
off,” 21159
said 21160
Gray 21161
Brother. 21162
 21163
“Tabaqui 21164
told 21165
him 21166
that, 21167
I 21168
know. 21169
He 21170
would 21171
never 21172
have 21173
thought 21174
of 21175
it 21176
alone.” 21177
Mowgli 21178
stood 21179
with 21180
his 21181
finger 21182
in 21183
his 21184
mouth, 21185
thinking. 21186
“The 21187
big 21188
ravine 21189
of 21190
the 21191
Waingunga. 21192
That 21193
opens 21194
out 21195
on 21196
the 21197
plain 21198
not 21199
half 21200
a 21201
mile 21202
from 21203
here. 21204
I 21205
can 21206
take 21207
the 21208
herd 21209
round 21210
through 21211
the 21212
jungle 21213
to 21214
the 21215
head 21216
of 21217
the 21218
ravine 21219
and 21220
then 21221
sweep 21222
down--but 21223
he 21224
would 21225
slink 21226
out 21227
at 21228
the 21229
foot. 21230
We 21231
must 21232
block 21233
that 21234
end. 21235
Gray 21236
Brother, 21237
canst 21238
thou 21239
cut 21240
the 21241
herd 21242
in 21243
two 21244
for 21245
me?” 21246
 21247
“Not 21248
I, 21249
perhaps--but 21250
I 21251
have 21252
brought 21253
a 21254
wise 21255
helper.” 21256
Gray 21257
Brother 21258
trotted 21259
off 21260
and 21261
dropped 21262
into 21263
a 21264
hole. 21265
Then 21266
there 21267
lifted 21268
up 21269
a 21270
huge 21271
gray 21272
head 21273
that 21274
Mowgli 21275
knew 21276
well, 21277
and 21278
the 21279
hot 21280
air 21281
was 21282
filled 21283
with 21284
the 21285
most 21286
desolate 21287
cry 21288
of 21289
all 21290
the 21291
jungle--the 21292
hunting 21293
howl 21294
of 21295
a 21296
wolf 21297
at 21298
midday. 21299
 21300
“Akela! 21301
Akela!” 21302
said 21303
Mowgli, 21304
clapping 21305
his 21306
hands. 21307
“I 21308
might 21309
have 21310
known 21311
that 21312
thou 21313
wouldst 21314
not 21315
forget 21316
me. 21317
We 21318
have 21319
a 21320
big 21321
work 21322
in 21323
hand. 21324
Cut 21325
the 21326
herd 21327
in 21328
two, 21329
Akela. 21330
Keep 21331
the 21332
cows 21333
and 21334
calves 21335
together, 21336
and 21337
the 21338
bulls 21339
and 21340
the 21341
plow 21342
buffaloes 21343
by 21344
themselves.” 21345
 21346
The 21347
two 21348
wolves 21349
ran, 21350
ladies’-chain 21351
fashion, 21352
in 21353
and 21354
out 21355
of 21356
the 21357
herd, 21358
which 21359
snorted 21360
and 21361
threw 21362
up 21363
its 21364
head, 21365
and 21366
separated 21367
into 21368
two 21369
clumps. 21370
In 21371
one, 21372
the 21373
cow-buffaloes 21374
stood 21375
with 21376
their 21377
calves 21378
in 21379
the 21380
center, 21381
and 21382
glared 21383
and 21384
pawed, 21385
ready, 21386
if 21387
a 21388
wolf 21389
would 21390
only 21391
stay 21392
still, 21393
to 21394
charge 21395
down 21396
and 21397
trample 21398
the 21399
life 21400
out 21401
of 21402
him. 21403
In 21404
the 21405
other, 21406
the 21407
bulls 21408
and 21409
the 21410
young 21411
bulls 21412
snorted 21413
and 21414
stamped, 21415
but 21416
though 21417
they 21418
looked 21419
more 21420
imposing 21421
they 21422
were 21423
much 21424
less 21425
dangerous, 21426
for 21427
they 21428
had 21429
no 21430
calves 21431
to 21432
protect. 21433
No 21434
six 21435
men 21436
could 21437
have 21438
divided 21439
the 21440
herd 21441
so 21442
neatly. 21443
 21444
“What 21445
orders!” 21446
panted 21447
Akela. 21448
“They 21449
are 21450
trying 21451
to 21452
join 21453
again.” 21454
 21455
Mowgli 21456
slipped 21457
on 21458
to 21459
Rama’s 21460
back. 21461
“Drive 21462
the 21463
bulls 21464
away 21465
to 21466
the 21467
left, 21468
Akela. 21469
Gray 21470
Brother, 21471
when 21472
we 21473
are 21474
gone, 21475
hold 21476
the 21477
cows 21478
together, 21479
and 21480
drive 21481
them 21482
into 21483
the 21484
foot 21485
of 21486
the 21487
ravine.” 21488
 21489
“How 21490
far?” 21491
said 21492
Gray 21493
Brother, 21494
panting 21495
and 21496
snapping. 21497
 21498
“Till 21499
the 21500
sides 21501
are 21502
higher 21503
than 21504
Shere 21505
Khan 21506
can 21507
jump,” 21508
shouted 21509
Mowgli. 21510
“Keep 21511
them 21512
there 21513
till 21514
we 21515
come 21516
down.” 21517
The 21518
bulls 21519
swept 21520
off 21521
as 21522
Akela 21523
bayed, 21524
and 21525
Gray 21526
Brother 21527
stopped 21528
in 21529
front 21530
of 21531
the 21532
cows. 21533
They 21534
charged 21535
down 21536
on 21537
him, 21538
and 21539
he 21540
ran 21541
just 21542
before 21543
them 21544
to 21545
the 21546
foot 21547
of 21548
the 21549
ravine, 21550
as 21551
Akela 21552
drove 21553
the 21554
bulls 21555
far 21556
to 21557
the 21558
left. 21559
 21560
“Well 21561
done! 21562
Another 21563
charge 21564
and 21565
they 21566
are 21567
fairly 21568
started. 21569
Careful, 21570
now--careful, 21571
Akela. 21572
A 21573
snap 21574
too 21575
much 21576
and 21577
the 21578
bulls 21579
will 21580
charge. 21581
Hujah! 21582
This 21583
is 21584
wilder 21585
work 21586
than 21587
driving 21588
black-buck. 21589
Didst 21590
thou 21591
think 21592
these 21593
creatures 21594
could 21595
move 21596
so 21597
swiftly?” 21598
Mowgli 21599
called. 21600
 21601
“I 21602
have--have 21603
hunted 21604
these 21605
too 21606
in 21607
my 21608
time,” 21609
gasped 21610
Akela 21611
in 21612
the 21613
dust. 21614
“Shall 21615
I 21616
turn 21617
them 21618
into 21619
the 21620
jungle?” 21621
 21622
“Ay! 21623
Turn. 21624
Swiftly 21625
turn 21626
them! 21627
Rama 21628
is 21629
mad 21630
with 21631
rage. 21632
Oh, 21633
if 21634
I 21635
could 21636
only 21637
tell 21638
him 21639
what 21640
I 21641
need 21642
of 21643
him 21644
to-day.” 21645
 21646
The 21647
bulls 21648
were 21649
turned, 21650
to 21651
the 21652
right 21653
this 21654
time, 21655
and 21656
crashed 21657
into 21658
the 21659
standing 21660
thicket. 21661
The 21662
other 21663
herd 21664
children, 21665
watching 21666
with 21667
the 21668
cattle 21669
half 21670
a 21671
mile 21672
away, 21673
hurried 21674
to 21675
the 21676
village 21677
as 21678
fast 21679
as 21680
their 21681
legs 21682
could 21683
carry 21684
them, 21685
crying 21686
that 21687
the 21688
buffaloes 21689
had 21690
gone 21691
mad 21692
and 21693
run 21694
away. 21695
 21696
But 21697
Mowgli’s 21698
plan 21699
was 21700
simple 21701
enough. 21702
All 21703
he 21704
wanted 21705
to 21706
do 21707
was 21708
to 21709
make 21710
a 21711
big 21712
circle 21713
uphill 21714
and 21715
get 21716
at 21717
the 21718
head 21719
of 21720
the 21721
ravine, 21722
and 21723
then 21724
take 21725
the 21726
bulls 21727
down 21728
it 21729
and 21730
catch 21731
Shere 21732
Khan 21733
between 21734
the 21735
bulls 21736
and 21737
the 21738
cows; 21739
for 21740
he 21741
knew 21742
that 21743
after 21744
a 21745
meal 21746
and 21747
a 21748
full 21749
drink 21750
Shere 21751
Khan 21752
would 21753
not 21754
be 21755
in 21756
any 21757
condition 21758
to 21759
fight 21760
or 21761
to 21762
clamber 21763
up 21764
the 21765
sides 21766
of 21767
the 21768
ravine. 21769
He 21770
was 21771
soothing 21772
the 21773
buffaloes 21774
now 21775
by 21776
voice, 21777
and 21778
Akela 21779
had 21780
dropped 21781
far 21782
to 21783
the 21784
rear, 21785
only 21786
whimpering 21787
once 21788
or 21789
twice 21790
to 21791
hurry 21792
the 21793
rear-guard. 21794
It 21795
was 21796
a 21797
long, 21798
long 21799
circle, 21800
for 21801
they 21802
did 21803
not 21804
wish 21805
to 21806
get 21807
too 21808
near 21809
the 21810
ravine 21811
and 21812
give 21813
Shere 21814
Khan 21815
warning. 21816
At 21817
last 21818
Mowgli 21819
rounded 21820
up 21821
the 21822
bewildered 21823
herd 21824
at 21825
the 21826
head 21827
of 21828
the 21829
ravine 21830
on 21831
a 21832
grassy 21833
patch 21834
that 21835
sloped 21836
steeply 21837
down 21838
to 21839
the 21840
ravine 21841
itself. 21842
From 21843
that 21844
height 21845
you 21846
could 21847
see 21848
across 21849
the 21850
tops 21851
of 21852
the 21853
trees 21854
down 21855
to 21856
the 21857
plain 21858
below; 21859
but 21860
what 21861
Mowgli 21862
looked 21863
at 21864
was 21865
the 21866
sides 21867
of 21868
the 21869
ravine, 21870
and 21871
he 21872
saw 21873
with 21874
a 21875
great 21876
deal 21877
of 21878
satisfaction 21879
that 21880
they 21881
ran 21882
nearly 21883
straight 21884
up 21885
and 21886
down, 21887
while 21888
the 21889
vines 21890
and 21891
creepers 21892
that 21893
hung 21894
over 21895
them 21896
would 21897
give 21898
no 21899
foothold 21900
to 21901
a 21902
tiger 21903
who 21904
wanted 21905
to 21906
get 21907
out. 21908
 21909
“Let 21910
them 21911
breathe, 21912
Akela,” 21913
he 21914
said, 21915
holding 21916
up 21917
his 21918
hand. 21919
“They 21920
have 21921
not 21922
winded 21923
him 21924
yet. 21925
Let 21926
them 21927
breathe. 21928
I 21929
must 21930
tell 21931
Shere 21932
Khan 21933
who 21934
comes. 21935
We 21936
have 21937
him 21938
in 21939
the 21940
trap.” 21941
 21942
He 21943
put 21944
his 21945
hands 21946
to 21947
his 21948
mouth 21949
and 21950
shouted 21951
down 21952
the 21953
ravine--it 21954
was 21955
almost 21956
like 21957
shouting 21958
down 21959
a 21960
tunnel--and 21961
the 21962
echoes 21963
jumped 21964
from 21965
rock 21966
to 21967
rock. 21968
 21969
After 21970
a 21971
long 21972
time 21973
there 21974
came 21975
back 21976
the 21977
drawling, 21978
sleepy 21979
snarl 21980
of 21981
a 21982
full-fed 21983
tiger 21984
just 21985
wakened. 21986
 21987
“Who 21988
calls?” 21989
said 21990
Shere 21991
Khan, 21992
and 21993
a 21994
splendid 21995
peacock 21996
fluttered 21997
up 21998
out 21999
of 22000
the 22001
ravine 22002
screeching. 22003
 22004
“I, 22005
Mowgli. 22006
Cattle 22007
thief, 22008
it 22009
is 22010
time 22011
to 22012
come 22013
to 22014
the 22015
Council 22016
Rock! 22017
Down--hurry 22018
them 22019
down, 22020
Akela! 22021
Down, 22022
Rama, 22023
down!” 22024
 22025
The 22026
herd 22027
paused 22028
for 22029
an 22030
instant 22031
at 22032
the 22033
edge 22034
of 22035
the 22036
slope, 22037
but 22038
Akela 22039
gave 22040
tongue 22041
in 22042
the 22043
full 22044
hunting-yell, 22045
and 22046
they 22047
pitched 22048
over 22049
one 22050
after 22051
the 22052
other, 22053
just 22054
as 22055
steamers 22056
shoot 22057
rapids, 22058
the 22059
sand 22060
and 22061
stones 22062
spurting 22063
up 22064
round 22065
them. 22066
Once 22067
started, 22068
there 22069
was 22070
no 22071
chance 22072
of 22073
stopping, 22074
and 22075
before 22076
they 22077
were 22078
fairly 22079
in 22080
the 22081
bed 22082
of 22083
the 22084
ravine 22085
Rama 22086
winded 22087
Shere 22088
Khan 22089
and 22090
bellowed. 22091
 22092
“Ha! 22093
Ha!” 22094
said 22095
Mowgli, 22096
on 22097
his 22098
back. 22099
“Now 22100
thou 22101
knowest!” 22102
and 22103
the 22104
torrent 22105
of 22106
black 22107
horns, 22108
foaming 22109
muzzles, 22110
and 22111
staring 22112
eyes 22113
whirled 22114
down 22115
the 22116
ravine 22117
just 22118
as 22119
boulders 22120
go 22121
down 22122
in 22123
floodtime; 22124
the 22125
weaker 22126
buffaloes 22127
being 22128
shouldered 22129
out 22130
to 22131
the 22132
sides 22133
of 22134
the 22135
ravine 22136
where 22137
they 22138
tore 22139
through 22140
the 22141
creepers. 22142
They 22143
knew 22144
what 22145
the 22146
business 22147
was 22148
before 22149
them--the 22150
terrible 22151
charge 22152
of 22153
the 22154
buffalo 22155
herd 22156
against 22157
which 22158
no 22159
tiger 22160
can 22161
hope 22162
to 22163
stand. 22164
Shere 22165
Khan 22166
heard 22167
the 22168
thunder 22169
of 22170
their 22171
hoofs, 22172
picked 22173
himself 22174
up, 22175
and 22176
lumbered 22177
down 22178
the 22179
ravine, 22180
looking 22181
from 22182
side 22183
to 22184
side 22185
for 22186
some 22187
way 22188
of 22189
escape, 22190
but 22191
the 22192
walls 22193
of 22194
the 22195
ravine 22196
were 22197
straight 22198
and 22199
he 22200
had 22201
to 22202
hold 22203
on, 22204
heavy 22205
with 22206
his 22207
dinner 22208
and 22209
his 22210
drink, 22211
willing 22212
to 22213
do 22214
anything 22215
rather 22216
than 22217
fight. 22218
The 22219
herd 22220
splashed 22221
through 22222
the 22223
pool 22224
he 22225
had 22226
just 22227
left, 22228
bellowing 22229
till 22230
the 22231
narrow 22232
cut 22233
rang. 22234
Mowgli 22235
heard 22236
an 22237
answering 22238
bellow 22239
from 22240
the 22241
foot 22242
of 22243
the 22244
ravine, 22245
saw 22246
Shere 22247
Khan 22248
turn 22249
(the 22250
tiger 22251
knew 22252
if 22253
the 22254
worst 22255
came 22256
to 22257
the 22258
worst 22259
it 22260
was 22261
better 22262
to 22263
meet 22264
the 22265
bulls 22266
than 22267
the 22268
cows 22269
with 22270
their 22271
calves), 22272
and 22273
then 22274
Rama 22275
tripped, 22276
stumbled, 22277
and 22278
went 22279
on 22280
again 22281
over 22282
something 22283
soft, 22284
and, 22285
with 22286
the 22287
bulls 22288
at 22289
his 22290
heels, 22291
crashed 22292
full 22293
into 22294
the 22295
other 22296
herd, 22297
while 22298
the 22299
weaker 22300
buffaloes 22301
were 22302
lifted 22303
clean 22304
off 22305
their 22306
feet 22307
by 22308
the 22309
shock 22310
of 22311
the 22312
meeting. 22313
That 22314
charge 22315
carried 22316
both 22317
herds 22318
out 22319
into 22320
the 22321
plain, 22322
goring 22323
and 22324
stamping 22325
and 22326
snorting. 22327
Mowgli 22328
watched 22329
his 22330
time, 22331
and 22332
slipped 22333
off 22334
Rama’s 22335
neck, 22336
laying 22337
about 22338
him 22339
right 22340
and 22341
left 22342
with 22343
his 22344
stick. 22345
 22346
“Quick, 22347
Akela! 22348
Break 22349
them 22350
up. 22351
Scatter 22352
them, 22353
or 22354
they 22355
will 22356
be 22357
fighting 22358
one 22359
another. 22360
Drive 22361
them 22362
away, 22363
Akela. 22364
Hai, 22365
Rama! 22366
Hai, 22367
hai, 22368
hai! 22369
my 22370
children. 22371
Softly 22372
now, 22373
softly! 22374
It 22375
is 22376
all 22377
over.” 22378
 22379
Akela 22380
and 22381
Gray 22382
Brother 22383
ran 22384
to 22385
and 22386
fro 22387
nipping 22388
the 22389
buffaloes’ 22390
legs, 22391
and 22392
though 22393
the 22394
herd 22395
wheeled 22396
once 22397
to 22398
charge 22399
up 22400
the 22401
ravine 22402
again, 22403
Mowgli 22404
managed 22405
to 22406
turn 22407
Rama, 22408
and 22409
the 22410
others 22411
followed 22412
him 22413
to 22414
the 22415
wallows. 22416
 22417
Shere 22418
Khan 22419
needed 22420
no 22421
more 22422
trampling. 22423
He 22424
was 22425
dead, 22426
and 22427
the 22428
kites 22429
were 22430
coming 22431
for 22432
him 22433
already. 22434
 22435
“Brothers, 22436
that 22437
was 22438
a 22439
dog’s 22440
death,” 22441
said 22442
Mowgli, 22443
feeling 22444
for 22445
the 22446
knife 22447
he 22448
always 22449
carried 22450
in 22451
a 22452
sheath 22453
round 22454
his 22455
neck 22456
now 22457
that 22458
he 22459
lived 22460
with 22461
men. 22462
“But 22463
he 22464
would 22465
never 22466
have 22467
shown 22468
fight. 22469
His 22470
hide 22471
will 22472
look 22473
well 22474
on 22475
the 22476
Council 22477
Rock. 22478
We 22479
must 22480
get 22481
to 22482
work 22483
swiftly.” 22484
 22485
A 22486
boy 22487
trained 22488
among 22489
men 22490
would 22491
never 22492
have 22493
dreamed 22494
of 22495
skinning 22496
a 22497
ten-foot 22498
tiger 22499
alone, 22500
but 22501
Mowgli 22502
knew 22503
better 22504
than 22505
anyone 22506
else 22507
how 22508
an 22509
animal’s 22510
skin 22511
is 22512
fitted 22513
on, 22514
and 22515
how 22516
it 22517
can 22518
be 22519
taken 22520
off. 22521
But 22522
it 22523
was 22524
hard 22525
work, 22526
and 22527
Mowgli 22528
slashed 22529
and 22530
tore 22531
and 22532
grunted 22533
for 22534
an 22535
hour, 22536
while 22537
the 22538
wolves 22539
lolled 22540
out 22541
their 22542
tongues, 22543
or 22544
came 22545
forward 22546
and 22547
tugged 22548
as 22549
he 22550
ordered 22551
them. 22552
Presently 22553
a 22554
hand 22555
fell 22556
on 22557
his 22558
shoulder, 22559
and 22560
looking 22561
up 22562
he 22563
saw 22564
Buldeo 22565
with 22566
the 22567
Tower 22568
musket. 22569
The 22570
children 22571
had 22572
told 22573
the 22574
village 22575
about 22576
the 22577
buffalo 22578
stampede, 22579
and 22580
Buldeo 22581
went 22582
out 22583
angrily, 22584
only 22585
too 22586
anxious 22587
to 22588
correct 22589
Mowgli 22590
for 22591
not 22592
taking 22593
better 22594
care 22595
of 22596
the 22597
herd. 22598
The 22599
wolves 22600
dropped 22601
out 22602
of 22603
sight 22604
as 22605
soon 22606
as 22607
they 22608
saw 22609
the 22610
man 22611
coming. 22612
 22613
“What 22614
is 22615
this 22616
folly?” 22617
said 22618
Buldeo 22619
angrily. 22620
“To 22621
think 22622
that 22623
thou 22624
canst 22625
skin 22626
a 22627
tiger! 22628
Where 22629
did 22630
the 22631
buffaloes 22632
kill 22633
him? 22634
It 22635
is 22636
the 22637
Lame 22638
Tiger 22639
too, 22640
and 22641
there 22642
is 22643
a 22644
hundred 22645
rupees 22646
on 22647
his 22648
head. 22649
Well, 22650
well, 22651
we 22652
will 22653
overlook 22654
thy 22655
letting 22656
the 22657
herd 22658
run 22659
off, 22660
and 22661
perhaps 22662
I 22663
will 22664
give 22665
thee 22666
one 22667
of 22668
the 22669
rupees 22670
of 22671
the 22672
reward 22673
when 22674
I 22675
have 22676
taken 22677
the 22678
skin 22679
to 22680
Khanhiwara.” 22681
 22682
He 22683
fumbled 22684
in 22685
his 22686
waist 22687
cloth 22688
for 22689
flint 22690
and 22691
steel, 22692
and 22693
stooped 22694
down 22695
to 22696
singe 22697
Shere 22698
Khan’s 22699
whiskers. 22700
Most 22701
native 22702
hunters 22703
always 22704
singe 22705
a 22706
tiger’s 22707
whiskers 22708
to 22709
prevent 22710
his 22711
ghost 22712
from 22713
haunting 22714
them. 22715
 22716
“Hum!” 22717
said 22718
Mowgli, 22719
half 22720
to 22721
himself 22722
as 22723
he 22724
ripped 22725
back 22726
the 22727
skin 22728
of 22729
a 22730
forepaw. 22731
“So 22732
thou 22733
wilt 22734
take 22735
the 22736
hide 22737
to 22738
Khanhiwara 22739
for 22740
the 22741
reward, 22742
and 22743
perhaps 22744
give 22745
me 22746
one 22747
rupee? 22748
Now 22749
it 22750
is 22751
in 22752
my 22753
mind 22754
that 22755
I 22756
need 22757
the 22758
skin 22759
for 22760
my 22761
own 22762
use. 22763
Heh! 22764
Old 22765
man, 22766
take 22767
away 22768
that 22769
fire!” 22770
 22771
“What 22772
talk 22773
is 22774
this 22775
to 22776
the 22777
chief 22778
hunter 22779
of 22780
the 22781
village? 22782
Thy 22783
luck 22784
and 22785
the 22786
stupidity 22787
of 22788
thy 22789
buffaloes 22790
have 22791
helped 22792
thee 22793
to 22794
this 22795
kill. 22796
The 22797
tiger 22798
has 22799
just 22800
fed, 22801
or 22802
he 22803
would 22804
have 22805
gone 22806
twenty 22807
miles 22808
by 22809
this 22810
time. 22811
Thou 22812
canst 22813
not 22814
even 22815
skin 22816
him 22817
properly, 22818
little 22819
beggar 22820
brat, 22821
and 22822
forsooth 22823
I, 22824
Buldeo, 22825
must 22826
be 22827
told 22828
not 22829
to 22830
singe 22831
his 22832
whiskers. 22833
Mowgli, 22834
I 22835
will 22836
not 22837
give 22838
thee 22839
one 22840
anna 22841
of 22842
the 22843
reward, 22844
but 22845
only 22846
a 22847
very 22848
big 22849
beating. 22850
Leave 22851
the 22852
carcass!” 22853
 22854
“By 22855
the 22856
Bull 22857
that 22858
bought 22859
me,” 22860
said 22861
Mowgli, 22862
who 22863
was 22864
trying 22865
to 22866
get 22867
at 22868
the 22869
shoulder, 22870
“must 22871
I 22872
stay 22873
babbling 22874
to 22875
an 22876
old 22877
ape 22878
all 22879
noon? 22880
Here, 22881
Akela, 22882
this 22883
man 22884
plagues 22885
me.” 22886
 22887
Buldeo, 22888
who 22889
was 22890
still 22891
stooping 22892
over 22893
Shere 22894
Khan’s 22895
head, 22896
found 22897
himself 22898
sprawling 22899
on 22900
the 22901
grass, 22902
with 22903
a 22904
gray 22905
wolf 22906
standing 22907
over 22908
him, 22909
while 22910
Mowgli 22911
went 22912
on 22913
skinning 22914
as 22915
though 22916
he 22917
were 22918
alone 22919
in 22920
all 22921
India. 22922
 22923
“Ye-es,” 22924
he 22925
said, 22926
between 22927
his 22928
teeth. 22929
“Thou 22930
art 22931
altogether 22932
right, 22933
Buldeo. 22934
Thou 22935
wilt 22936
never 22937
give 22938
me 22939
one 22940
anna 22941
of 22942
the 22943
reward. 22944
There 22945
is 22946
an 22947
old 22948
war 22949
between 22950
this 22951
lame 22952
tiger 22953
and 22954
myself--a 22955
very 22956
old 22957
war, 22958
and--I 22959
have 22960
won.” 22961
 22962
To 22963
do 22964
Buldeo 22965
justice, 22966
if 22967
he 22968
had 22969
been 22970
ten 22971
years 22972
younger 22973
he 22974
would 22975
have 22976
taken 22977
his 22978
chance 22979
with 22980
Akela 22981
had 22982
he 22983
met 22984
the 22985
wolf 22986
in 22987
the 22988
woods, 22989
but 22990
a 22991
wolf 22992
who 22993
obeyed 22994
the 22995
orders 22996
of 22997
this 22998
boy 22999
who 23000
had 23001
private 23002
wars 23003
with 23004
man-eating 23005
tigers 23006
was 23007
not 23008
a 23009
common 23010
animal. 23011
It 23012
was 23013
sorcery, 23014
magic 23015
of 23016
the 23017
worst 23018
kind, 23019
thought 23020
Buldeo, 23021
and 23022
he 23023
wondered 23024
whether 23025
the 23026
amulet 23027
round 23028
his 23029
neck 23030
would 23031
protect 23032
him. 23033
He 23034
lay 23035
as 23036
still 23037
as 23038
still, 23039
expecting 23040
every 23041
minute 23042
to 23043
see 23044
Mowgli 23045
turn 23046
into 23047
a 23048
tiger 23049
too. 23050
 23051
“Maharaj! 23052
Great 23053
King,” 23054
he 23055
said 23056
at 23057
last 23058
in 23059
a 23060
husky 23061
whisper. 23062
 23063
“Yes,” 23064
said 23065
Mowgli, 23066
without 23067
turning 23068
his 23069
head, 23070
chuckling 23071
a 23072
little. 23073
 23074
“I 23075
am 23076
an 23077
old 23078
man. 23079
I 23080
did 23081
not 23082
know 23083
that 23084
thou 23085
wast 23086
anything 23087
more 23088
than 23089
a 23090
herdsboy. 23091
May 23092
I 23093
rise 23094
up 23095
and 23096
go 23097
away, 23098
or 23099
will 23100
thy 23101
servant 23102
tear 23103
me 23104
to 23105
pieces?” 23106
 23107
“Go, 23108
and 23109
peace 23110
go 23111
with 23112
thee. 23113
Only, 23114
another 23115
time 23116
do 23117
not 23118
meddle 23119
with 23120
my 23121
game. 23122
Let 23123
him 23124
go, 23125
Akela.” 23126
 23127
Buldeo 23128
hobbled 23129
away 23130
to 23131
the 23132
village 23133
as 23134
fast 23135
as 23136
he 23137
could, 23138
looking 23139
back 23140
over 23141
his 23142
shoulder 23143
in 23144
case 23145
Mowgli 23146
should 23147
change 23148
into 23149
something 23150
terrible. 23151
When 23152
he 23153
got 23154
to 23155
the 23156
village 23157
he 23158
told 23159
a 23160
tale 23161
of 23162
magic 23163
and 23164
enchantment 23165
and 23166
sorcery 23167
that 23168
made 23169
the 23170
priest 23171
look 23172
very 23173
grave. 23174
 23175
Mowgli 23176
went 23177
on 23178
with 23179
his 23180
work, 23181
but 23182
it 23183
was 23184
nearly 23185
twilight 23186
before 23187
he 23188
and 23189
the 23190
wolves 23191
had 23192
drawn 23193
the 23194
great 23195
gay 23196
skin 23197
clear 23198
of 23199
the 23200
body. 23201
 23202
“Now 23203
we 23204
must 23205
hide 23206
this 23207
and 23208
take 23209
the 23210
buffaloes 23211
home! 23212
Help 23213
me 23214
to 23215
herd 23216
them, 23217
Akela.” 23218
 23219
The 23220
herd 23221
rounded 23222
up 23223
in 23224
the 23225
misty 23226
twilight, 23227
and 23228
when 23229
they 23230
got 23231
near 23232
the 23233
village 23234
Mowgli 23235
saw 23236
lights, 23237
and 23238
heard 23239
the 23240
conches 23241
and 23242
bells 23243
in 23244
the 23245
temple 23246
blowing 23247
and 23248
banging. 23249
Half 23250
the 23251
village 23252
seemed 23253
to 23254
be 23255
waiting 23256
for 23257
him 23258
by 23259
the 23260
gate. 23261
“That 23262
is 23263
because 23264
I 23265
have 23266
killed 23267
Shere 23268
Khan,” 23269
he 23270
said 23271
to 23272
himself. 23273
But 23274
a 23275
shower 23276
of 23277
stones 23278
whistled 23279
about 23280
his 23281
ears, 23282
and 23283
the 23284
villagers 23285
shouted: 23286
“Sorcerer! 23287
Wolf’s 23288
brat! 23289
Jungle 23290
demon! 23291
Go 23292
away! 23293
Get 23294
hence 23295
quickly 23296
or 23297
the 23298
priest 23299
will 23300
turn 23301
thee 23302
into 23303
a 23304
wolf 23305
again. 23306
Shoot, 23307
Buldeo, 23308
shoot!” 23309
 23310
The 23311
old 23312
Tower 23313
musket 23314
went 23315
off 23316
with 23317
a 23318
bang, 23319
and 23320
a 23321
young 23322
buffalo 23323
bellowed 23324
in 23325
pain. 23326
 23327
“More 23328
sorcery!” 23329
shouted 23330
the 23331
villagers. 23332
“He 23333
can 23334
turn 23335
bullets. 23336
Buldeo, 23337
that 23338
was 23339
thy 23340
buffalo.” 23341
 23342
“Now 23343
what 23344
is 23345
this?” 23346
said 23347
Mowgli, 23348
bewildered, 23349
as 23350
the 23351
stones 23352
flew 23353
thicker. 23354
 23355
“They 23356
are 23357
not 23358
unlike 23359
the 23360
Pack, 23361
these 23362
brothers 23363
of 23364
thine,” 23365
said 23366
Akela, 23367
sitting 23368
down 23369
composedly. 23370
“It 23371
is 23372
in 23373
my 23374
head 23375
that, 23376
if 23377
bullets 23378
mean 23379
anything, 23380
they 23381
would 23382
cast 23383
thee 23384
out.” 23385
 23386
“Wolf! 23387
Wolf’s 23388
cub! 23389
Go 23390
away!” 23391
shouted 23392
the 23393
priest, 23394
waving 23395
a 23396
sprig 23397
of 23398
the 23399
sacred 23400
tulsi 23401
plant. 23402
 23403
“Again? 23404
Last 23405
time 23406
it 23407
was 23408
because 23409
I 23410
was 23411
a 23412
man. 23413
This 23414
time 23415
it 23416
is 23417
because 23418
I 23419
am 23420
a 23421
wolf. 23422
Let 23423
us 23424
go, 23425
Akela.” 23426
 23427
A 23428
woman--it 23429
was 23430
Messua--ran 23431
across 23432
to 23433
the 23434
herd, 23435
and 23436
cried: 23437
“Oh, 23438
my 23439
son, 23440
my 23441
son! 23442
They 23443
say 23444
thou 23445
art 23446
a 23447
sorcerer 23448
who 23449
can 23450
turn 23451
himself 23452
into 23453
a 23454
beast 23455
at 23456
will. 23457
I 23458
do 23459
not 23460
believe, 23461
but 23462
go 23463
away 23464
or 23465
they 23466
will 23467
kill 23468
thee. 23469
Buldeo 23470
says 23471
thou 23472
art 23473
a 23474
wizard, 23475
but 23476
I 23477
know 23478
thou 23479
hast 23480
avenged 23481
Nathoo’s 23482
death.” 23483
 23484
“Come 23485
back, 23486
Messua!” 23487
shouted 23488
the 23489
crowd. 23490
“Come 23491
back, 23492
or 23493
we 23494
will 23495
stone 23496
thee.” 23497
 23498
Mowgli 23499
laughed 23500
a 23501
little 23502
short 23503
ugly 23504
laugh, 23505
for 23506
a 23507
stone 23508
had 23509
hit 23510
him 23511
in 23512
the 23513
mouth. 23514
“Run 23515
back, 23516
Messua. 23517
This 23518
is 23519
one 23520
of 23521
the 23522
foolish 23523
tales 23524
they 23525
tell 23526
under 23527
the 23528
big 23529
tree 23530
at 23531
dusk. 23532
I 23533
have 23534
at 23535
least 23536
paid 23537
for 23538
thy 23539
son’s 23540
life. 23541
Farewell; 23542
and 23543
run 23544
quickly, 23545
for 23546
I 23547
shall 23548
send 23549
the 23550
herd 23551
in 23552
more 23553
swiftly 23554
than 23555
their 23556
brickbats. 23557
I 23558
am 23559
no 23560
wizard, 23561
Messua. 23562
Farewell!” 23563
 23564
“Now, 23565
once 23566
more, 23567
Akela,” 23568
he 23569
cried. 23570
“Bring 23571
the 23572
herd 23573
in.” 23574
 23575
The 23576
buffaloes 23577
were 23578
anxious 23579
enough 23580
to 23581
get 23582
to 23583
the 23584
village. 23585
They 23586
hardly 23587
needed 23588
Akela’s 23589
yell, 23590
but 23591
charged 23592
through 23593
the 23594
gate 23595
like 23596
a 23597
whirlwind, 23598
scattering 23599
the 23600
crowd 23601
right 23602
and 23603
left. 23604
 23605
“Keep 23606
count!” 23607
shouted 23608
Mowgli 23609
scornfully. 23610
“It 23611
may 23612
be 23613
that 23614
I 23615
have 23616
stolen 23617
one 23618
of 23619
them. 23620
Keep 23621
count, 23622
for 23623
I 23624
will 23625
do 23626
your 23627
herding 23628
no 23629
more. 23630
Fare 23631
you 23632
well, 23633
children 23634
of 23635
men, 23636
and 23637
thank 23638
Messua 23639
that 23640
I 23641
do 23642
not 23643
come 23644
in 23645
with 23646
my 23647
wolves 23648
and 23649
hunt 23650
you 23651
up 23652
and 23653
down 23654
your 23655
street.” 23656
 23657
He 23658
turned 23659
on 23660
his 23661
heel 23662
and 23663
walked 23664
away 23665
with 23666
the 23667
Lone 23668
Wolf, 23669
and 23670
as 23671
he 23672
looked 23673
up 23674
at 23675
the 23676
stars 23677
he 23678
felt 23679
happy. 23680
“No 23681
more 23682
sleeping 23683
in 23684
traps 23685
for 23686
me, 23687
Akela. 23688
Let 23689
us 23690
get 23691
Shere 23692
Khan’s 23693
skin 23694
and 23695
go 23696
away. 23697
No, 23698
we 23699
will 23700
not 23701
hurt 23702
the 23703
village, 23704
for 23705
Messua 23706
was 23707
kind 23708
to 23709
me.” 23710
 23711
When 23712
the 23713
moon 23714
rose 23715
over 23716
the 23717
plain, 23718
making 23719
it 23720
look 23721
all 23722
milky, 23723
the 23724
horrified 23725
villagers 23726
saw 23727
Mowgli, 23728
with 23729
two 23730
wolves 23731
at 23732
his 23733
heels 23734
and 23735
a 23736
bundle 23737
on 23738
his 23739
head, 23740
trotting 23741
across 23742
at 23743
the 23744
steady 23745
wolf’s 23746
trot 23747
that 23748
eats 23749
up 23750
the 23751
long 23752
miles 23753
like 23754
fire. 23755
Then 23756
they 23757
banged 23758
the 23759
temple 23760
bells 23761
and 23762
blew 23763
the 23764
conches 23765
louder 23766
than 23767
ever. 23768
And 23769
Messua 23770
cried, 23771
and 23772
Buldeo 23773
embroidered 23774
the 23775
story 23776
of 23777
his 23778
adventures 23779
in 23780
the 23781
jungle, 23782
till 23783
he 23784
ended 23785
by 23786
saying 23787
that 23788
Akela 23789
stood 23790
up 23791
on 23792
his 23793
hind 23794
legs 23795
and 23796
talked 23797
like 23798
a 23799
man. 23800
 23801
The 23802
moon 23803
was 23804
just 23805
going 23806
down 23807
when 23808
Mowgli 23809
and 23810
the 23811
two 23812
wolves 23813
came 23814
to 23815
the 23816
hill 23817
of 23818
the 23819
Council 23820
Rock, 23821
and 23822
they 23823
stopped 23824
at 23825
Mother 23826
Wolf’s 23827
cave. 23828
 23829
“They 23830
have 23831
cast 23832
me 23833
out 23834
from 23835
the 23836
Man-Pack, 23837
Mother,” 23838
shouted 23839
Mowgli, 23840
“but 23841
I 23842
come 23843
with 23844
the 23845
hide 23846
of 23847
Shere 23848
Khan 23849
to 23850
keep 23851
my 23852
word.” 23853
 23854
Mother 23855
Wolf 23856
walked 23857
stiffly 23858
from 23859
the 23860
cave 23861
with 23862
the 23863
cubs 23864
behind 23865
her, 23866
and 23867
her 23868
eyes 23869
glowed 23870
as 23871
she 23872
saw 23873
the 23874
skin. 23875
 23876
“I 23877
told 23878
him 23879
on 23880
that 23881
day, 23882
when 23883
he 23884
crammed 23885
his 23886
head 23887
and 23888
shoulders 23889
into 23890
this 23891
cave, 23892
hunting 23893
for 23894
thy 23895
life, 23896
Little 23897
Frog--I 23898
told 23899
him 23900
that 23901
the 23902
hunter 23903
would 23904
be 23905
the 23906
hunted. 23907
It 23908
is 23909
well 23910
done.” 23911
 23912
“Little 23913
Brother, 23914
it 23915
is 23916
well 23917
done,” 23918
said 23919
a 23920
deep 23921
voice 23922
in 23923
the 23924
thicket. 23925
“We 23926
were 23927
lonely 23928
in 23929
the 23930
jungle 23931
without 23932
thee,” 23933
and 23934
Bagheera 23935
came 23936
running 23937
to 23938
Mowgli’s 23939
bare 23940
feet. 23941
They 23942
clambered 23943
up 23944
the 23945
Council 23946
Rock 23947
together, 23948
and 23949
Mowgli 23950
spread 23951
the 23952
skin 23953
out 23954
on 23955
the 23956
flat 23957
stone 23958
where 23959
Akela 23960
used 23961
to 23962
sit, 23963
and 23964
pegged 23965
it 23966
down 23967
with 23968
four 23969
slivers 23970
of 23971
bamboo, 23972
and 23973
Akela 23974
lay 23975
down 23976
upon 23977
it, 23978
and 23979
called 23980
the 23981
old 23982
call 23983
to 23984
the 23985
Council, 23986
“Look--look 23987
well, 23988
O 23989
Wolves,” 23990
 23991
exactly 23992
as 23993
he 23994
had 23995
called 23996
when 23997
Mowgli 23998
was 23999
first 24000
brought 24001
there. 24002
 24003
Ever 24004
since 24005
Akela 24006
had 24007
been 24008
deposed, 24009
the 24010
Pack 24011
had 24012
been 24013
without 24014
a 24015
leader, 24016
hunting 24017
and 24018
fighting 24019
at 24020
their 24021
own 24022
pleasure. 24023
But 24024
they 24025
answered 24026
the 24027
call 24028
from 24029
habit; 24030
and 24031
some 24032
of 24033
them 24034
were 24035
lame 24036
from 24037
the 24038
traps 24039
they 24040
had 24041
fallen 24042
into, 24043
and 24044
some 24045
limped 24046
from 24047
shot 24048
wounds, 24049
and 24050
some 24051
were 24052
mangy 24053
from 24054
eating 24055
bad 24056
food, 24057
and 24058
many 24059
were 24060
missing. 24061
But 24062
they 24063
came 24064
to 24065
the 24066
Council 24067
Rock, 24068
all 24069
that 24070
were 24071
left 24072
of 24073
them, 24074
and 24075
saw 24076
Shere 24077
Khan’s 24078
striped 24079
hide 24080
on 24081
the 24082
rock, 24083
and 24084
the 24085
huge 24086
claws 24087
dangling 24088
at 24089
the 24090
end 24091
of 24092
the 24093
empty 24094
dangling 24095
feet. 24096
It 24097
was 24098
then 24099
that 24100
Mowgli 24101
made 24102
up 24103
a 24104
song 24105
that 24106
came 24107
up 24108
into 24109
his 24110
throat 24111
all 24112
by 24113
itself, 24114
and 24115
he 24116
shouted 24117
it 24118
aloud, 24119
leaping 24120
up 24121
and 24122
down 24123
on 24124
the 24125
rattling 24126
skin, 24127
and 24128
beating 24129
time 24130
with 24131
his 24132
heels 24133
till 24134
he 24135
had 24136
no 24137
more 24138
breath 24139
left, 24140
while 24141
Gray 24142
Brother 24143
and 24144
Akela 24145
howled 24146
between 24147
the 24148
verses. 24149
 24150
“Look 24151
well, 24152
O 24153
Wolves. 24154
Have 24155
I 24156
kept 24157
my 24158
word?” 24159
said 24160
Mowgli. 24161
And 24162
the 24163
wolves 24164
bayed 24165
“Yes,” 24166
and 24167
one 24168
tattered 24169
wolf 24170
howled: 24171
 24172
“Lead 24173
us 24174
again, 24175
O 24176
Akela. 24177
Lead 24178
us 24179
again, 24180
O 24181
Man-cub, 24182
for 24183
we 24184
be 24185
sick 24186
of 24187
this 24188
lawlessness, 24189
and 24190
we 24191
would 24192
be 24193
the 24194
Free 24195
People 24196
once 24197
more.” 24198
 24199
“Nay,” 24200
purred 24201
Bagheera, 24202
“that 24203
may 24204
not 24205
be. 24206
When 24207
ye 24208
are 24209
full-fed, 24210
the 24211
madness 24212
may 24213
come 24214
upon 24215
you 24216
again. 24217
Not 24218
for 24219
nothing 24220
are 24221
ye 24222
called 24223
the 24224
Free 24225
People. 24226
Ye 24227
fought 24228
for 24229
freedom, 24230
and 24231
it 24232
is 24233
yours. 24234
Eat 24235
it, 24236
O 24237
Wolves.” 24238
 24239
“Man-Pack 24240
and 24241
Wolf-Pack 24242
have 24243
cast 24244
me 24245
out,” 24246
said 24247
Mowgli. 24248
“Now 24249
I 24250
will 24251
hunt 24252
alone 24253
in 24254
the 24255
jungle.” 24256
 24257
“And 24258
we 24259
will 24260
hunt 24261
with 24262
thee,” 24263
said 24264
the 24265
four 24266
cubs. 24267
 24268
So 24269
Mowgli 24270
went 24271
away 24272
and 24273
hunted 24274
with 24275
the 24276
four 24277
cubs 24278
in 24279
the 24280
jungle 24281
from 24282
that 24283
day 24284
on. 24285
But 24286
he 24287
was 24288
not 24289
always 24290
alone, 24291
because, 24292
years 24293
afterward, 24294
he 24295
became 24296
a 24297
man 24298
and 24299
married. 24300
 24301
But 24302
that 24303
is 24304
a 24305
story 24306
for 24307
grown-ups. 24308
 24309
 24310
 24311
 24312
Mowgli’s 24313
Song 24314
 24315
 24316
 24317
 24318
 24319
 24320
THAT 24321
HE 24322
SANG 24323
AT 24324
THE 24325
COUNCIL 24326
ROCK 24327
WHEN 24328
HE 24329
 24330
 24331
 24332
 24333
 24334
DANCED 24335
ON 24336
SHERE 24337
KHAN’S 24338
HIDE 24339
 24340
The 24341
Song 24342
of 24343
Mowgli—I, 24344
Mowgli, 24345
am 24346
singing. 24347
Let 24348
the 24349
jungle 24350
listen 24351
to 24352
the 24353
things 24354
I 24355
have 24356
done. 24357
Shere 24358
Khan 24359
said 24360
he 24361
would 24362
kill—would 24363
kill! 24364
At 24365
the 24366
gates 24367
in 24368
the 24369
twilight 24370
he 24371
would 24372
kill 24373
Mowgli, 24374
the 24375
Frog! 24376
He 24377
ate 24378
and 24379
he 24380
drank. 24381
Drink 24382
deep, 24383
Shere 24384
Khan, 24385
for 24386
when 24387
wilt 24388
thou 24389
drink 24390
again? 24391
Sleep 24392
and 24393
dream 24394
of 24395
the 24396
kill. 24397
I 24398
am 24399
alone 24400
on 24401
the 24402
grazing-grounds. 24403
Gray 24404
Brother, 24405
come 24406
to 24407
me! 24408
Come 24409
to 24410
me, 24411
Lone 24412
Wolf, 24413
for 24414
there 24415
is 24416
big 24417
game 24418
afoot! 24419
Bring 24420
up 24421
the 24422
great 24423
bull 24424
buffaloes, 24425
the 24426
blue-skinned 24427
herd 24428
bulls 24429
with 24430
the 24431
angry 24432
eyes. 24433
Drive 24434
them 24435
to 24436
and 24437
fro 24438
as 24439
I 24440
order. 24441
Sleepest 24442
thou 24443
still, 24444
Shere 24445
Khan? 24446
Wake, 24447
oh, 24448
wake! 24449
Here 24450
come 24451
I, 24452
and 24453
the 24454
bulls 24455
are 24456
behind. 24457
Rama, 24458
the 24459
King 24460
of 24461
the 24462
Buffaloes, 24463
stamped 24464
with 24465
his 24466
foot. 24467
Waters 24468
of 24469
the 24470
Waingunga, 24471
whither 24472
went 24473
Shere 24474
Khan? 24475
He 24476
is 24477
not 24478
Ikki 24479
to 24480
dig 24481
holes, 24482
nor 24483
Mao, 24484
the 24485
Peacock, 24486
that 24487
he 24488
should 24489
fly. 24490
He 24491
is 24492
not 24493
Mang 24494
the 24495
Bat, 24496
to 24497
hang 24498
in 24499
the 24500
branches. 24501
Little 24502
bamboos 24503
that 24504
creak 24505
together, 24506
tell 24507
me 24508
where 24509
he 24510
ran? 24511
_Ow!_ 24512
He 24513
is 24514
there. 24515
_Ahoo!_ 24516
He 24517
is 24518
there. 24519
Under 24520
the 24521
feet 24522
of 24523
Rama 24524
lies 24525
the 24526
Lame 24527
One! 24528
Up, 24529
Shere 24530
Khan! 24531
Up 24532
and 24533
kill! 24534
Here 24535
is 24536
meat; 24537
break 24538
the 24539
necks 24540
of 24541
the 24542
bulls! 24543
_Hsh!_ 24544
He 24545
is 24546
asleep. 24547
We 24548
will 24549
not 24550
wake 24551
him, 24552
for 24553
his 24554
strength 24555
is 24556
very 24557
great. 24558
The 24559
kites 24560
have 24561
come 24562
down 24563
to 24564
see 24565
it. 24566
The 24567
black 24568
ants 24569
have 24570
come 24571
up 24572
to 24573
know 24574
it. 24575
There 24576
is 24577
a 24578
great 24579
assembly 24580
in 24581
his 24582
honor. 24583
_Alala!_ 24584
I 24585
have 24586
no 24587
cloth 24588
to 24589
wrap 24590
me. 24591
The 24592
kites 24593
will 24594
see 24595
that 24596
I 24597
am 24598
naked. 24599
I 24600
am 24601
ashamed 24602
to 24603
meet 24604
all 24605
these 24606
people. 24607
Lend 24608
me 24609
thy 24610
coat, 24611
Shere 24612
Khan. 24613
Lend 24614
me 24615
thy 24616
gay 24617
striped 24618
coat 24619
that 24620
I 24621
may 24622
go 24623
to 24624
the 24625
Council 24626
Rock. 24627
By 24628
the 24629
Bull 24630
that 24631
bought 24632
me 24633
I 24634
made 24635
a 24636
promise—a 24637
little 24638
promise. 24639
Only 24640
thy 24641
coat 24642
is 24643
lacking 24644
before 24645
I 24646
keep 24647
my 24648
word. 24649
With 24650
the 24651
knife, 24652
with 24653
the 24654
knife 24655
that 24656
men 24657
use, 24658
with 24659
the 24660
knife 24661
of 24662
the 24663
hunter, 24664
I 24665
will 24666
stoop 24667
down 24668
for 24669
my 24670
gift. 24671
Waters 24672
of 24673
the 24674
Waingunga, 24675
Shere 24676
Khan 24677
gives 24678
me 24679
his 24680
coat 24681
for 24682
the 24683
love 24684
that 24685
he 24686
bears 24687
me. 24688
Pull, 24689
Gray 24690
Brother! 24691
Pull, 24692
Akela! 24693
Heavy 24694
is 24695
the 24696
hide 24697
of 24698
Shere 24699
Khan. 24700
The 24701
Man 24702
Pack 24703
are 24704
angry. 24705
They 24706
throw 24707
stones 24708
and 24709
talk 24710
child’s 24711
talk. 24712
My 24713
mouth 24714
is 24715
bleeding. 24716
Let 24717
me 24718
run 24719
away. 24720
Through 24721
the 24722
night, 24723
through 24724
the 24725
hot 24726
night, 24727
run 24728
swiftly 24729
with 24730
me, 24731
my 24732
brothers. 24733
We 24734
will 24735
leave 24736
the 24737
lights 24738
of 24739
the 24740
village 24741
and 24742
go 24743
to 24744
the 24745
low 24746
moon. 24747
Waters 24748
of 24749
the 24750
Waingunga, 24751
the 24752
Man-Pack 24753
have 24754
cast 24755
me 24756
out. 24757
I 24758
did 24759
them 24760
no 24761
harm, 24762
but 24763
they 24764
were 24765
afraid 24766
of 24767
me. 24768
Why? 24769
Wolf 24770
Pack, 24771
ye 24772
have 24773
cast 24774
me 24775
out 24776
too. 24777
The 24778
jungle 24779
is 24780
shut 24781
to 24782
me 24783
and 24784
the 24785
village 24786
gates 24787
are 24788
shut. 24789
Why? 24790
As 24791
Mang 24792
flies 24793
between 24794
the 24795
beasts 24796
and 24797
birds, 24798
so 24799
fly 24800
I 24801
between 24802
the 24803
village 24804
and 24805
the 24806
jungle. 24807
Why? 24808
I 24809
dance 24810
on 24811
the 24812
hide 24813
of 24814
Shere 24815
Khan, 24816
but 24817
my 24818
heart 24819
is 24820
very 24821
heavy. 24822
My 24823
mouth 24824
is 24825
cut 24826
and 24827
wounded 24828
with 24829
the 24830
stones 24831
from 24832
the 24833
village, 24834
but 24835
my 24836
heart 24837
is 24838
very 24839
light, 24840
because 24841
I 24842
have 24843
come 24844
back 24845
to 24846
the 24847
jungle. 24848
Why? 24849
These 24850
two 24851
things 24852
fight 24853
together 24854
in 24855
me 24856
as 24857
the 24858
snakes 24859
fight 24860
in 24861
the 24862
spring. 24863
The 24864
water 24865
comes 24866
out 24867
of 24868
my 24869
eyes; 24870
yet 24871
I 24872
laugh 24873
while 24874
it 24875
falls. 24876
Why? 24877
I 24878
am 24879
two 24880
Mowglis, 24881
but 24882
the 24883
hide 24884
of 24885
Shere 24886
Khan 24887
is 24888
under 24889
my 24890
feet. 24891
All 24892
the 24893
jungle 24894
knows 24895
that 24896
I 24897
have 24898
killed 24899
Shere 24900
Khan. 24901
Look—look 24902
well, 24903
O 24904
Wolves! 24905
_Ahae!_ 24906
My 24907
heart 24908
is 24909
heavy 24910
with 24911
the 24912
things 24913
that 24914
I 24915
do 24916
not 24917
understand. 24918
 24919
 24920
 24921
 24922
The 24923
White 24924
Seal 24925
 24926
 24927
 24928
 24929
 24930
 24931
Oh! 24932
hush 24933
thee, 24934
my 24935
baby, 24936
the 24937
night 24938
is 24939
behind 24940
us, 24941
 24942
 24943
 24944
 24945
 24946
 24947
 24948
 24949
And 24950
black 24951
are 24952
the 24953
waters 24954
that 24955
sparkled 24956
so 24957
green. 24958
 24959
 24960
 24961
 24962
 24963
The 24964
moon, 24965
o’er 24966
the 24967
combers, 24968
looks 24969
downward 24970
to 24971
find 24972
us 24973
 24974
 24975
 24976
 24977
 24978
 24979
 24980
 24981
At 24982
rest 24983
in 24984
the 24985
hollows 24986
that 24987
rustle 24988
between. 24989
 24990
 24991
 24992
 24993
 24994
Where 24995
billow 24996
meets 24997
billow, 24998
then 24999
soft 25000
be 25001
thy 25002
pillow, 25003
 25004
 25005
 25006
 25007
 25008
 25009
 25010
 25011
Ah, 25012
weary 25013
wee 25014
flipperling, 25015
curl 25016
at 25017
thy 25018
ease! 25019
 25020
 25021
 25022
 25023
 25024
The 25025
storm 25026
shall 25027
not 25028
wake 25029
thee, 25030
nor 25031
shark 25032
overtake 25033
thee, 25034
 25035
 25036

several 25106

Bering 25129
Sea. 25130
Limmershin, 25131
the 25132
Winter 25133
Wren, 25134
told 25135
me 25136
the 25137
tale 25138
when 25139
he 25140
was 25141
blown 25142
on 25143
to 25144
the 25145
rigging 25146
of 25147
a 25148
steamer 25149
going 25150
to 25151
Japan, 25152
and 25153
I 25154
took 25155
him 25156
down 25157
into 25158
my 25159
cabin 25160
and 25161
warmed 25162
and 25163
fed 25164
him 25165
for 25166
a 25167
couple 25168
of 25169
days 25170
till 25171
he 25172
was 25173
fit 25174
to 25175
fly 25176
back 25177
to 25178
St. 25179
Paul’s 25180
again. 25181
Limmershin 25182
is 25183
a 25184
very 25185
quaint 25186
little 25187
bird, 25188
but 25189
he 25190
knows 25191
how 25192
to 25193
tell 25194
the 25195
truth. 25196
 25197
Nobody 25198
comes 25199
to 25200
Novastoshnah 25201
except 25202
on 25203
business, 25204
and 25205
the 25206
only 25207
people 25208
who 25209
have 25210
regular 25211
business 25212
there 25213
are 25214
the 25215
seals. 25216
They 25217
come 25218
in 25219
the 25220
summer 25221
months 25222
by 25223
hundreds 25224
and 25225
hundreds 25226
of 25227
thousands 25228
out 25229
of 25230
the 25231
cold 25232
gray 25233
sea. 25234
For 25235
Novastoshnah 25236
Beach 25237
has 25238
the 25239
finest 25240
accommodation 25241
for 25242
seals 25243
of 25244
any 25245
place 25246
in 25247
all 25248
the 25249
world. 25250
 25251
Sea 25252
Catch 25253
knew 25254
that, 25255
and 25256
every 25257
spring 25258
would 25259
swim 25260
from 25261
whatever 25262
place 25263
he 25264
happened 25265
to 25266
be 25267
in--would 25268
swim 25269
like 25270
a 25271
torpedo-boat 25272
straight 25273
for 25274
Novastoshnah 25275
and 25276
spend 25277
a 25278
month 25279
fighting 25280
with 25281
his 25282
companions 25283
for 25284
a 25285
good 25286
place 25287
on 25288
the 25289
rocks, 25290
as 25291
close 25292
to 25293
the 25294
sea 25295
as 25296
possible. 25297
Sea 25298
Catch 25299
was 25300
fifteen 25301
years 25302
old, 25303
a 25304
huge 25305
gray 25306
fur 25307
seal 25308
with 25309
almost 25310
a 25311
mane 25312
on 25313
his 25314
shoulders, 25315
and 25316
long, 25317
wicked 25318
dog 25319
teeth. 25320
When 25321
he 25322
heaved 25323
himself 25324
up 25325
on 25326
his 25327
front 25328
flippers 25329
he 25330
stood 25331
more 25332
than 25333
four 25334
feet 25335
clear 25336
of 25337
the 25338
ground, 25339
and 25340
his 25341
weight, 25342
if 25343
anyone 25344
had 25345
been 25346
bold 25347
enough 25348
to 25349
weigh 25350
him, 25351
was 25352
nearly 25353
seven 25354
hundred 25355
pounds. 25356
He 25357
was 25358
scarred 25359
all 25360
over 25361
with 25362
the 25363
marks 25364
of 25365
savage 25366
fights, 25367
but 25368
he 25369
was 25370
always 25371
ready 25372
for 25373
just 25374
one 25375
fight 25376
more. 25377
He 25378
would 25379
put 25380
his 25381
head 25382
on 25383
one 25384
side, 25385
as 25386
though 25387
he 25388
were 25389
afraid 25390
to 25391
look 25392
his 25393
enemy 25394
in 25395
the 25396
face; 25397
then 25398
he 25399
would 25400
shoot 25401
it 25402
out 25403
like 25404
lightning, 25405
and 25406
when 25407
the 25408
big 25409
teeth 25410
were 25411
firmly 25412
fixed 25413
on 25414
the 25415
other 25416
seal’s 25417
neck, 25418
the 25419
other 25420
seal 25421
might 25422
get 25423
away 25424
if 25425
he 25426
could, 25427
but 25428
Sea 25429
Catch 25430
would 25431
not 25432
help 25433
him. 25434
 25435
Yet 25436
Sea 25437
Catch 25438
never 25439
chased 25440
a 25441
beaten 25442
seal, 25443
for 25444
that 25445
was 25446
against 25447
the 25448
Rules 25449
of 25450
the 25451
Beach. 25452
He 25453
only 25454
wanted 25455
room 25456
by 25457
the 25458
sea 25459
for 25460
his 25461
nursery. 25462
But 25463
as 25464
there 25465
were 25466
forty 25467
or 25468
fifty 25469
thousand 25470
other 25471
seals 25472
hunting 25473
for 25474
the 25475
same 25476
thing 25477
each 25478
spring, 25479
the 25480
whistling, 25481
bellowing, 25482
roaring, 25483
and 25484
blowing 25485
on 25486
the 25487
beach 25488
was 25489
something 25490
frightful. 25491
 25492
From 25493
a 25494
little 25495
hill 25496
called 25497
Hutchinson’s 25498
Hill, 25499
you 25500
could 25501
look 25502
over 25503
three 25504
and 25505
a 25506
half 25507
miles 25508
of 25509
ground 25510
covered 25511
with 25512
fighting 25513
seals; 25514
and 25515
the 25516
surf 25517
was 25518
dotted 25519
all 25520
over 25521
with 25522
the 25523
heads 25524
of 25525
seals 25526
hurrying 25527
to 25528
land 25529
and 25530
begin 25531
their 25532
share 25533
of 25534
the 25535
fighting. 25536
They 25537
fought 25538
in 25539
the 25540
breakers, 25541
they 25542
fought 25543
in 25544
the 25545
sand, 25546
and 25547
they 25548
fought 25549
on 25550
the 25551
smooth-worn 25552
basalt 25553
rocks 25554
of 25555
the 25556
nurseries, 25557
for 25558
they 25559
were 25560
just 25561
as 25562
stupid 25563
and 25564
unaccommodating 25565
as 25566
men. 25567
Their 25568
wives 25569
never 25570
came 25571
to 25572
the 25573
island 25574
until 25575
late 25576
in 25577
May 25578
or 25579
early 25580
in 25581
June, 25582
for 25583
they 25584
did 25585
not 25586
care 25587
to 25588
be 25589
torn 25590
to 25591
pieces; 25592
and 25593
the 25594
young 25595
two-, 25596
three-, 25597
and 25598
four-year-old 25599
seals 25600
who 25601
had 25602
not 25603
begun 25604
housekeeping 25605
went 25606
inland 25607
about 25608
half 25609
a 25610
mile 25611
through 25612
the 25613
ranks 25614
of 25615
the 25616
fighters 25617
and 25618
played 25619
about 25620
on 25621
the 25622
sand 25623
dunes 25624
in 25625
droves 25626
and 25627
legions, 25628
and 25629
rubbed 25630
off 25631
every 25632
single 25633
green 25634
thing 25635
that 25636
grew. 25637
They 25638
were 25639
called 25640
the 25641
holluschickie--the 25642
bachelors--and 25643
there 25644
were 25645
perhaps 25646
two 25647
or 25648
three 25649
hundred 25650
thousand 25651
of 25652
them 25653
at 25654
Novastoshnah 25655
alone. 25656
 25657
Sea 25658
Catch 25659
had 25660
just 25661
finished 25662
his 25663
forty-fifth 25664
fight 25665
one 25666
spring 25667
when 25668
Matkah, 25669
his 25670
soft, 25671
sleek, 25672
gentle-eyed 25673
wife, 25674
came 25675
up 25676
out 25677
of 25678
the 25679
sea, 25680
and 25681
he 25682
caught 25683
her 25684
by 25685
the 25686
scruff 25687
of 25688
the 25689
neck 25690
and 25691
dumped 25692
her 25693
down 25694
on 25695
his 25696
reservation, 25697
saying 25698
gruffly: 25699
“Late 25700
as 25701
usual. 25702
Where 25703
have 25704
you 25705
been?” 25706
 25707
It 25708
was 25709
not 25710
the 25711
fashion 25712
for 25713
Sea 25714
Catch 25715
to 25716
eat 25717
anything 25718
during 25719
the 25720
four 25721
months 25722
he 25723
stayed 25724
on 25725
the 25726
beaches, 25727
and 25728
so 25729
his 25730
temper 25731
was 25732
generally 25733
bad. 25734
Matkah 25735
knew 25736
better 25737
than 25738
to 25739
answer 25740
back. 25741
She 25742
looked 25743
round 25744
and 25745
cooed: 25746
“How 25747
thoughtful 25748
of 25749
you. 25750
You’ve 25751
taken 25752
the 25753
old 25754
place 25755
again.” 25756
 25757
“I 25758
should 25759
think 25760
I 25761
had,” 25762
said 25763
Sea 25764
Catch. 25765
“Look 25766
at 25767
me!” 25768
 25769
He 25770
was 25771
scratched 25772
and 25773
bleeding 25774
in 25775
twenty 25776
places; 25777
one 25778
eye 25779
was 25780
almost 25781
out, 25782
and 25783
his 25784
sides 25785
were 25786
torn 25787
to 25788
ribbons. 25789
 25790
“Oh, 25791
you 25792
men, 25793
you 25794
men!” 25795
Matkah 25796
said, 25797
fanning 25798
herself 25799
with 25800
her 25801
hind 25802
flipper. 25803
“Why 25804
can’t 25805
you 25806
be 25807
sensible 25808
and 25809
settle 25810
your 25811
places 25812
quietly? 25813
You 25814
look 25815
as 25816
though 25817
you 25818
had 25819
been 25820
fighting 25821
with 25822
the 25823
Killer 25824
Whale.” 25825
 25826
“I 25827
haven’t 25828
been 25829
doing 25830
anything 25831
but 25832
fight 25833
since 25834
the 25835
middle 25836
of 25837
May. 25838
The 25839
beach 25840
is 25841
disgracefully 25842
crowded 25843
this 25844
season. 25845
I’ve 25846
met 25847
at 25848
least 25849
a 25850
hundred 25851
seals 25852
from 25853
Lukannon 25854
Beach, 25855
house 25856
hunting. 25857
Why 25858
can’t 25859
people 25860
stay 25861
where 25862
they 25863
belong?” 25864
 25865
“I’ve 25866
often 25867
thought 25868
we 25869
should 25870
be 25871
much 25872
happier 25873
if 25874
we 25875
hauled 25876
out 25877
at 25878
Otter 25879
Island 25880
instead 25881
of 25882
this 25883
crowded 25884
place,” 25885
said 25886
Matkah. 25887
 25888
“Bah! 25889
Only 25890
the 25891
holluschickie 25892
go 25893
to 25894
Otter 25895
Island. 25896
If 25897
we 25898
went 25899
there 25900
they 25901
would 25902
say 25903
we 25904
were 25905
afraid. 25906
We 25907
must 25908
preserve 25909
appearances, 25910
my 25911
dear.” 25912
 25913
Sea 25914
Catch 25915
sunk 25916
his 25917
head 25918
proudly 25919
between 25920
his 25921
fat 25922
shoulders 25923
and 25924
pretended 25925
to 25926
go 25927
to 25928
sleep 25929
for 25930
a 25931
few 25932
minutes, 25933
but 25934
all 25935
the 25936
time 25937
he 25938
was 25939
keeping 25940
a 25941
sharp 25942
lookout 25943
for 25944
a 25945
fight. 25946
Now 25947
that 25948
all 25949
the 25950
seals 25951
and 25952
their 25953
wives 25954
were 25955
on 25956
the 25957
land, 25958
you 25959
could 25960
hear 25961
their 25962
clamor 25963
miles 25964
out 25965
to 25966
sea 25967
above 25968
the 25969
loudest 25970
gales. 25971
At 25972
the 25973
lowest 25974
counting 25975
there 25976
were 25977
over 25978
a 25979
million 25980
seals 25981
on 25982
the 25983
beach--old 25984
seals, 25985
mother 25986
seals, 25987
tiny 25988
babies, 25989
and 25990
holluschickie, 25991
fighting, 25992
scuffling, 25993
bleating, 25994
crawling, 25995
and 25996
playing 25997
together--going 25998
down 25999
to 26000
the 26001
sea 26002
and 26003
coming 26004
up 26005
from 26006
it 26007
in 26008
gangs 26009
and 26010
regiments, 26011
lying 26012
over 26013
every 26014
foot 26015
of 26016
ground 26017
as 26018
far 26019
as 26020
the 26021
eye 26022
could 26023
reach, 26024
and 26025
skirmishing 26026
about 26027
in 26028
brigades 26029
through 26030
the 26031
fog. 26032
It 26033
is 26034
nearly 26035
always 26036
foggy 26037
at 26038
Novastoshnah, 26039
except 26040
when 26041
the 26042
sun 26043
comes 26044
out 26045
and 26046
makes 26047
everything 26048
look 26049
all 26050
pearly 26051
and 26052
rainbow-colored 26053
for 26054
a 26055
little 26056
while. 26057
 26058
Kotick, 26059
Matkah’s 26060
baby, 26061
was 26062
born 26063
in 26064
the 26065
middle 26066
of 26067
that 26068
confusion, 26069
and 26070
he 26071
was 26072
all 26073
head 26074
and 26075
shoulders, 26076
with 26077
pale, 26078
watery 26079
blue 26080
eyes, 26081
as 26082
tiny 26083
seals 26084
must 26085
be, 26086
but 26087
there 26088
was 26089
something 26090
about 26091
his 26092
coat 26093
that 26094
made 26095
his 26096
mother 26097
look 26098
at 26099
him 26100
very 26101
closely. 26102
 26103
“Sea 26104
Catch,” 26105
she 26106
said, 26107
at 26108
last, 26109
“our 26110
baby’s 26111
going 26112
to 26113
be 26114
white!” 26115
 26116
“Empty 26117
clam-shells 26118
and 26119
dry 26120
seaweed!” 26121
snorted 26122
Sea 26123
Catch. 26124
“There 26125
never 26126
has 26127
been 26128
such 26129
a 26130
thing 26131
in 26132
the 26133
world 26134
as 26135
a 26136
white 26137
seal.” 26138
 26139
“I 26140
can’t 26141
help 26142
that,” 26143
said 26144
Matkah; 26145
“there’s 26146
going 26147
to 26148
be 26149
now.” 26150
And 26151
she 26152
sang 26153
the 26154
low, 26155
crooning 26156
seal 26157
song 26158
that 26159
all 26160
the 26161
mother 26162
seals 26163
sing 26164
to 26165
their 26166
babies: 26167
 26168
 26169
 26170
 26171
 26172
 26173
You 26174
mustn’t 26175
swim 26176
till 26177
you’re 26178
six 26179
weeks 26180
old, 26181
 26182
 26183
 26184
 26185
 26186
 26187
 26188
 26189
Or 26190
your 26191
head 26192
will 26193
be 26194
sunk 26195
by 26196
your 26197
heels; 26198
 26199
 26200
 26201
 26202
 26203
And 26204
summer 26205
gales 26206
and 26207
Killer 26208
Whales 26209
 26210
 26211
 26212
 26213
 26214
 26215
 26216
 26217
Are 26218
bad 26219
for 26220
baby 26221
seals. 26222
 26223
 26224
 26225
 26226
 26227
 26228
Are 26229
bad 26230
for 26231
baby 26232
seals, 26233
dear 26234
rat, 26235
 26236
 26237
 26238
 26239
 26240
 26241
 26242
 26243
As 26244
bad 26245
as 26246
bad 26247
can 26248
be; 26249
 26250
 26251
 26252
 26253
 26254
But 26255
splash 26256
and 26257
grow 26258
strong, 26259
 26260
 26261
 26262
 26263
 26264
And 26265
you 26266
can’t 26267
be 26268
wrong. 26269
 26270
 26271
 26272
 26273
 26274
 26275
 26276
 26277
Child 26278
of 26279
the 26280
Open 26281
Sea! 26282
 26283
Of 26284
course 26285
the 26286
little 26287
fellow 26288
did 26289
not 26290
understand 26291
the 26292
words 26293
at 26294
first. 26295
He 26296
paddled 26297
and 26298
scrambled 26299
about 26300
by 26301
his 26302
mother’s 26303
side, 26304
and 26305
learned 26306
to 26307
scuffle 26308
out 26309
of 26310
the 26311
way 26312
when 26313
his 26314
father 26315
was 26316
fighting 26317
with 26318
another 26319
seal, 26320
and 26321
the 26322
two 26323
rolled 26324
and 26325
roared 26326
up 26327
and 26328
down 26329
the 26330
slippery 26331
rocks. 26332
Matkah 26333
used 26334
to 26335
go 26336
to 26337
sea 26338
to 26339
get 26340
things 26341
to 26342
eat, 26343
and 26344
the 26345
baby 26346
was 26347
fed 26348
only 26349
once 26350
in 26351
two 26352
days, 26353
but 26354
then 26355
he 26356
ate 26357
all 26358
he 26359
could 26360
and 26361
throve 26362
upon 26363
it. 26364
 26365
The 26366
first 26367
thing 26368
he 26369
did 26370
was 26371
to 26372
crawl 26373
inland, 26374
and 26375
there 26376
he 26377
met 26378
tens 26379
of 26380
thousands 26381
of 26382
babies 26383
of 26384
his 26385
own 26386
age, 26387
and 26388
they 26389
played 26390
together 26391
like 26392
puppies, 26393
went 26394
to 26395
sleep 26396
on 26397
the 26398
clean 26399
sand, 26400
and 26401
played 26402
again. 26403
The 26404
old 26405
people 26406
in 26407
the 26408
nurseries 26409
took 26410
no 26411
notice 26412
of 26413
them, 26414
and 26415
the 26416
holluschickie 26417
kept 26418
to 26419
their 26420
own 26421
grounds, 26422
and 26423
the 26424
babies 26425
had 26426
a 26427
beautiful 26428
playtime. 26429
 26430
When 26431
Matkah 26432
came 26433
back 26434
from 26435
her 26436
deep-sea 26437
fishing 26438
she 26439
would 26440
go 26441
straight 26442
to 26443
their 26444
playground 26445
and 26446
call 26447
as 26448
a 26449
sheep 26450
calls 26451
for 26452
a 26453
lamb, 26454
and 26455
wait 26456
until 26457
she 26458
heard 26459
Kotick 26460
bleat. 26461
Then 26462
she 26463
would 26464
take 26465
the 26466
straightest 26467
of 26468
straight 26469
lines 26470
in 26471
his 26472
direction, 26473
striking 26474
out 26475
with 26476
her 26477
fore 26478
flippers 26479
and 26480
knocking 26481
the 26482
youngsters 26483
head 26484
over 26485
heels 26486
right 26487
and 26488
left. 26489
There 26490
were 26491
always 26492
a 26493
few 26494
hundred 26495
mothers 26496
hunting 26497
for 26498
their 26499
children 26500
through 26501
the 26502
playgrounds, 26503
and 26504
the 26505
babies 26506
were 26507
kept 26508
lively. 26509
But, 26510
as 26511
Matkah 26512
told 26513
Kotick, 26514
“So 26515
long 26516
as 26517
you 26518
don’t 26519
lie 26520
in 26521
muddy 26522
water 26523
and 26524
get 26525
mange, 26526
or 26527
rub 26528
the 26529
hard 26530
sand 26531
into 26532
a 26533
cut 26534
or 26535
scratch, 26536
and 26537
so 26538
long 26539
as 26540
you 26541
never 26542
go 26543
swimming 26544
when 26545
there 26546
is 26547
a 26548
heavy 26549
sea, 26550
nothing 26551
will 26552
hurt 26553
you 26554
here.” 26555
 26556
Little 26557
seals 26558
can 26559
no 26560
more 26561
swim 26562
than 26563
little 26564
children, 26565
but 26566
they 26567
are 26568
unhappy 26569
till 26570
they 26571
learn. 26572
The 26573
first 26574
time 26575
that 26576
Kotick 26577
went 26578
down 26579
to 26580
the 26581
sea 26582
a 26583
wave 26584
carried 26585
him 26586
out 26587
beyond 26588
his 26589
depth, 26590
and 26591
his 26592
big 26593
head 26594
sank 26595
and 26596
his 26597
little 26598
hind 26599
flippers 26600
flew 26601
up 26602
exactly 26603
as 26604
his 26605
mother 26606
had 26607
told 26608
him 26609
in 26610
the 26611
song, 26612
and 26613
if 26614
the 26615
next 26616
wave 26617
had 26618
not 26619
thrown 26620
him 26621
back 26622
again 26623
he 26624
would 26625
have 26626
drowned. 26627
 26628
After 26629
that, 26630
he 26631
learned 26632
to 26633
lie 26634
in 26635
a 26636
beach 26637
pool 26638
and 26639
let 26640
the 26641
wash 26642
of 26643
the 26644
waves 26645
just 26646
cover 26647
him 26648
and 26649
lift 26650
him 26651
up 26652
while 26653
he 26654
paddled, 26655
but 26656
he 26657
always 26658
kept 26659
his 26660
eye 26661
open 26662
for 26663
big 26664
waves 26665
that 26666
might 26667
hurt. 26668
He 26669
was 26670
two 26671
weeks 26672
learning 26673
to 26674
use 26675
his 26676
flippers; 26677
and 26678
all 26679
that 26680
while 26681
he 26682
floundered 26683
in 26684
and 26685
out 26686
of 26687
the 26688
water, 26689
and 26690
coughed 26691
and 26692
grunted 26693
and 26694
crawled 26695
up 26696
the 26697
beach 26698
and 26699
took 26700
catnaps 26701
on 26702
the 26703
sand, 26704
and 26705
went 26706
back 26707
again, 26708
until 26709
at 26710
last 26711
he 26712
found 26713
that 26714
he 26715
truly 26716
belonged 26717
to 26718
the 26719
water. 26720
 26721
Then 26722
you 26723
can 26724
imagine 26725
the 26726
times 26727
that 26728
he 26729
had 26730
with 26731
his 26732
companions, 26733
ducking 26734
under 26735
the 26736
rollers; 26737
or 26738
coming 26739
in 26740
on 26741
top 26742
of 26743
a 26744
comber 26745
and 26746
landing 26747
with 26748
a 26749
swash 26750
and 26751
a 26752
splutter 26753
as 26754
the 26755
big 26756
wave 26757
went 26758
whirling 26759
far 26760
up 26761
the 26762
beach; 26763
or 26764
standing 26765
up 26766
on 26767
his 26768
tail 26769
and 26770
scratching 26771
his 26772
head 26773
as 26774
the 26775
old 26776
people 26777
did; 26778
or 26779
playing 26780
“I’m 26781
the 26782
King 26783
of 26784
the 26785
Castle” 26786
on 26787
slippery, 26788
weedy 26789
rocks 26790
that 26791
just 26792
stuck 26793
out 26794
of 26795
the 26796
wash. 26797
Now 26798
and 26799
then 26800
he 26801
would 26802
see 26803
a 26804
thin 26805
fin, 26806
like 26807
a 26808
big 26809
shark’s 26810
fin, 26811
drifting 26812
along 26813
close 26814
to 26815
shore, 26816
and 26817
he 26818
knew 26819
that 26820
that 26821
was 26822
the 26823
Killer 26824
Whale, 26825
the 26826
Grampus, 26827
who 26828
eats 26829
young 26830
seals 26831
when 26832
he 26833
can 26834
get 26835
them; 26836
and 26837
Kotick 26838
would 26839
head 26840
for 26841
the 26842
beach 26843
like 26844
an 26845
arrow, 26846
and 26847
the 26848
fin 26849
would 26850
jig 26851
off 26852
slowly, 26853
as 26854
if 26855
it 26856
were 26857
looking 26858
for 26859
nothing 26860
at 26861
all. 26862
 26863
Late 26864
in 26865
October 26866
the 26867
seals 26868
began 26869
to 26870
leave 26871
St. 26872
Paul’s 26873
for 26874
the 26875
deep 26876
sea, 26877
by 26878
families 26879
and 26880
tribes, 26881
and 26882
there 26883
was 26884
no 26885
more 26886
fighting 26887
over 26888
the 26889
nurseries, 26890
and 26891
the 26892
holluschickie 26893
played 26894
anywhere 26895
they 26896
liked. 26897
“Next 26898
year,” 26899
said 26900
Matkah 26901
to 26902
Kotick, 26903
“you 26904
will 26905
be 26906
a 26907
holluschickie; 26908
but 26909
this 26910
year 26911
you 26912
must 26913
learn 26914
how 26915
to 26916
catch 26917
fish.” 26918
 26919
They 26920
set 26921
out 26922
together 26923
across 26924
the 26925
Pacific, 26926
and 26927
Matkah 26928
showed 26929
Kotick 26930
how 26931
to 26932
sleep 26933
on 26934
his 26935
back 26936
with 26937
his 26938
flippers 26939
tucked 26940
down 26941
by 26942
his 26943
side 26944
and 26945
his 26946
little 26947
nose 26948
just 26949
out 26950
of 26951
the 26952
water. 26953
No 26954
cradle 26955
is 26956
so 26957
comfortable 26958
as 26959
the 26960
long, 26961
rocking 26962
swell 26963
of 26964
the 26965
Pacific. 26966
When 26967
Kotick 26968
felt 26969
his 26970
skin 26971
tingle 26972
all 26973
over, 26974
Matkah 26975
told 26976
him 26977
he 26978
was 26979
learning 26980
the 26981
“feel 26982
of 26983
the 26984
water,” 26985
and 26986
that 26987
tingly, 26988
prickly 26989
feelings 26990
meant 26991
bad 26992
weather 26993
coming, 26994
and 26995
he 26996
must 26997
swim 26998
hard 26999
and 27000
get 27001
away. 27002
 27003
“In 27004
a 27005
little 27006
time,” 27007
she 27008
said, 27009
“you’ll 27010
know 27011
where 27012
to 27013
swim 27014
to, 27015
but 27016
just 27017
now 27018
we’ll 27019
follow 27020
Sea 27021
Pig, 27022
the 27023
Porpoise, 27024
for 27025
he 27026
is 27027
very 27028
wise.” 27029
A 27030
school 27031
of 27032
porpoises 27033
were 27034
ducking 27035
and 27036
tearing 27037
through 27038
the 27039
water, 27040
and 27041
little 27042
Kotick 27043
followed 27044
them 27045
as 27046
fast 27047
as 27048
he 27049
could. 27050
“How 27051
do 27052
you 27053
know 27054
where 27055
to 27056
go 27057
to?” 27058
he 27059
panted. 27060
The 27061
leader 27062
of 27063
the 27064
school 27065
rolled 27066
his 27067
white 27068
eye 27069
and 27070
ducked 27071
under. 27072
“My 27073
tail 27074
tingles, 27075
youngster,” 27076
he 27077
said. 27078
“That 27079
means 27080
there’s 27081
a 27082
gale 27083
behind 27084
me. 27085
Come 27086
along! 27087
When 27088
you’re 27089
south 27090
of 27091
the 27092
Sticky 27093
Water 27094
[he 27095
meant 27096
the 27097
Equator] 27098
and 27099
your 27100
tail 27101
tingles, 27102
that 27103
means 27104
there’s 27105
a 27106
gale 27107
in 27108
front 27109
of 27110
you 27111
and 27112
you 27113
must 27114
head 27115
north. 27116
Come 27117
along! 27118
The 27119
water 27120
feels 27121
bad 27122
here.” 27123
 27124
This 27125
was 27126
one 27127
of 27128
very 27129
many 27130
things 27131
that 27132
Kotick 27133
learned, 27134
and 27135
he 27136
was 27137
always 27138
learning. 27139
Matkah 27140
taught 27141
him 27142
to 27143
follow 27144
the 27145
cod 27146
and 27147
the 27148
halibut 27149
along 27150
the 27151
under-sea 27152
banks 27153
and 27154
wrench 27155
the 27156
rockling 27157
out 27158
of 27159
his 27160
hole 27161
among 27162
the 27163
weeds; 27164
how 27165
to 27166
skirt 27167
the 27168
wrecks 27169
lying 27170
a 27171
hundred 27172
fathoms 27173
below 27174
water 27175
and 27176
dart 27177
like 27178
a 27179
rifle 27180
bullet 27181
in 27182
at 27183
one 27184
porthole 27185
and 27186
out 27187
at 27188
another 27189
as 27190
the 27191
fishes 27192
ran; 27193
how 27194
to 27195
dance 27196
on 27197
the 27198
top 27199
of 27200
the 27201
waves 27202
when 27203
the 27204
lightning 27205
was 27206
racing 27207
all 27208
over 27209
the 27210
sky, 27211
and 27212
wave 27213
his 27214
flipper 27215
politely 27216
to 27217
the 27218
stumpy-tailed 27219
Albatross 27220
and 27221
the 27222
Man-of-war 27223
Hawk 27224
as 27225
they 27226
went 27227
down 27228
the 27229
wind; 27230
how 27231
to 27232
jump 27233
three 27234
or 27235
four 27236
feet 27237
clear 27238
of 27239
the 27240
water 27241
like 27242
a 27243
dolphin, 27244
flippers 27245
close 27246
to 27247
the 27248
side 27249
and 27250
tail 27251
curved; 27252
to 27253
leave 27254
the 27255
flying 27256
fish 27257
alone 27258
because 27259
they 27260
are 27261
all 27262
bony; 27263
to 27264
take 27265
the 27266
shoulder-piece 27267
out 27268
of 27269
a 27270
cod 27271
at 27272
full 27273
speed 27274
ten 27275
fathoms 27276
deep, 27277
and 27278
never 27279
to 27280
stop 27281
and 27282
look 27283
at 27284
a 27285
boat 27286
or 27287
a 27288
ship, 27289
but 27290
particularly 27291
a 27292
row-boat. 27293
At 27294
the 27295
end 27296
of 27297
six 27298
months 27299
what 27300
Kotick 27301
did 27302
not 27303
know 27304
about 27305
deep-sea 27306
fishing 27307
was 27308
not 27309
worth 27310
the 27311
knowing. 27312
And 27313
all 27314
that 27315
time 27316
he 27317
never 27318
set 27319
flipper 27320
on 27321
dry 27322
ground. 27323
 27324
One 27325
day, 27326
however, 27327
as 27328
he 27329
was 27330
lying 27331
half 27332
asleep 27333
in 27334
the 27335
warm 27336
water 27337
somewhere 27338
off 27339
the 27340
Island 27341
of 27342
Juan 27343
Fernandez, 27344
he 27345
felt 27346
faint 27347
and 27348
lazy 27349
all 27350
over, 27351
just 27352
as 27353
human 27354
people 27355
do 27356
when 27357
the 27358
spring 27359
is 27360
in 27361
their 27362
legs, 27363
and 27364
he 27365
remembered 27366
the 27367
good 27368
firm 27369
beaches 27370
of 27371
Novastoshnah 27372
seven 27373
thousand 27374
miles 27375
away, 27376
the 27377
games 27378
his 27379
companions 27380
played, 27381
the 27382
smell 27383
of 27384
the 27385
seaweed, 27386
the 27387
seal 27388
roar, 27389
and 27390
the 27391
fighting. 27392
That 27393
very 27394
minute 27395
he 27396
turned 27397
north, 27398
swimming 27399
steadily, 27400
and 27401
as 27402
he 27403
went 27404
on 27405
he 27406
met 27407
scores 27408
of 27409
his 27410
mates, 27411
all 27412
bound 27413
for 27414
the 27415
same 27416
place, 27417
and 27418
they 27419
said: 27420
“Greeting, 27421
Kotick! 27422
This 27423
year 27424
we 27425
are 27426
all 27427
holluschickie, 27428
and 27429
we 27430
can 27431
dance 27432
the 27433
Fire-dance 27434
in 27435
the 27436
breakers 27437
off 27438
Lukannon 27439
and 27440
play 27441
on 27442
the 27443
new 27444
grass. 27445
But 27446
where 27447
did 27448
you 27449
get 27450
that 27451
coat?” 27452
 27453
Kotick’s 27454
fur 27455
was 27456
almost 27457
pure 27458
white 27459
now, 27460
and 27461
though 27462
he 27463
felt 27464
very 27465
proud 27466
of 27467
it, 27468
he 27469
only 27470
said, 27471
“Swim 27472
quickly! 27473
My 27474
bones 27475
are 27476
aching 27477
for 27478
the 27479
land.” 27480
And 27481
so 27482
they 27483
all 27484
came 27485
to 27486
the 27487
beaches 27488
where 27489
they 27490
had 27491
been 27492
born, 27493
and 27494
heard 27495
the 27496
old 27497
seals, 27498
their 27499
fathers, 27500
fighting 27501
in 27502
the 27503
rolling 27504
mist. 27505
 27506
That 27507
night 27508
Kotick 27509
danced 27510
the 27511
Fire-dance 27512
with 27513
the 27514
yearling 27515
seals. 27516
The 27517
sea 27518
is 27519
full 27520
of 27521
fire 27522
on 27523
summer 27524
nights 27525
all 27526
the 27527
way 27528
down 27529
from 27530
Novastoshnah 27531
to 27532
Lukannon, 27533
and 27534
each 27535
seal 27536
leaves 27537
a 27538
wake 27539
like 27540
burning 27541
oil 27542
behind 27543
him 27544
and 27545
a 27546
flaming 27547
flash 27548
when 27549
he 27550
jumps, 27551
and 27552
the 27553
waves 27554
break 27555
in 27556
great 27557
phosphorescent 27558
streaks 27559
and 27560
swirls. 27561
Then 27562
they 27563
went 27564
inland 27565
to 27566
the 27567
holluschickie 27568
grounds 27569
and 27570
rolled 27571
up 27572
and 27573
down 27574
in 27575
the 27576
new 27577
wild 27578
wheat 27579
and 27580
told 27581
stories 27582
of 27583
what 27584
they 27585
had 27586
done 27587
while 27588
they 27589
had 27590
been 27591
at 27592
sea. 27593
They 27594
talked 27595
about 27596
the 27597
Pacific 27598
as 27599
boys 27600
would 27601
talk 27602
about 27603
a 27604
wood 27605
that 27606
they 27607
had 27608
been 27609
nutting 27610
in, 27611
and 27612
if 27613
anyone 27614
had 27615
understood 27616
them 27617
he 27618
could 27619
have 27620
gone 27621
away 27622
and 27623
made 27624
such 27625
a 27626
chart 27627
of 27628
that 27629
ocean 27630
as 27631
never 27632
was. 27633
The 27634
three- 27635
and 27636
four-year-old 27637
holluschickie 27638
romped 27639
down 27640
from 27641
Hutchinson’s 27642
Hill 27643
crying: 27644
“Out 27645
of 27646
the 27647
way, 27648
youngsters! 27649
The 27650
sea 27651
is 27652
deep 27653
and 27654
you 27655
don’t 27656
know 27657
all 27658
that’s 27659
in 27660
it 27661
yet. 27662
Wait 27663
till 27664
you’ve 27665
rounded 27666
the 27667
Horn. 27668
Hi, 27669
you 27670
yearling, 27671
where 27672
did 27673
you 27674
get 27675
that 27676
white 27677
coat?” 27678
 27679
“I 27680
didn’t 27681
get 27682
it,” 27683
said 27684
Kotick. 27685
“It 27686
grew.” 27687
And 27688
just 27689
as 27690
he 27691
was 27692
going 27693
to 27694
roll 27695
the 27696
speaker 27697
over, 27698
a 27699
couple 27700
of 27701
black-haired 27702
men 27703
with 27704
flat 27705
red 27706
faces 27707
came 27708
from 27709
behind 27710
a 27711
sand 27712
dune, 27713
and 27714
Kotick, 27715
who 27716
had 27717
never 27718
seen 27719
a 27720
man 27721
before, 27722
coughed 27723
and 27724
lowered 27725
his 27726
head. 27727
The 27728
holluschickie 27729
just 27730
bundled 27731
off 27732
a 27733
few 27734
yards 27735
and 27736
sat 27737
staring 27738
stupidly. 27739
The 27740
men 27741
were 27742
no 27743
less 27744
than 27745
Kerick 27746
Booterin, 27747
the 27748
chief 27749
of 27750
the 27751
seal-hunters 27752
on 27753
the 27754
island, 27755
and 27756
Patalamon, 27757
his 27758
son. 27759
They 27760
came 27761
from 27762
the 27763
little 27764
village 27765
not 27766
half 27767
a 27768
mile 27769
from 27770
the 27771
sea 27772
nurseries, 27773
and 27774
they 27775
were 27776
deciding 27777
what 27778
seals 27779
they 27780
would 27781
drive 27782
up 27783
to 27784
the 27785
killing 27786
pens--for 27787
the 27788
seals 27789
were 27790
driven 27791
just 27792
like 27793
sheep--to 27794
be 27795
turned 27796
into 27797
seal-skin 27798
jackets 27799
later 27800
on. 27801
 27802
“Ho!” 27803
said 27804
Patalamon. 27805
“Look! 27806
There’s 27807
a 27808
white 27809
seal!” 27810
 27811
Kerick 27812
Booterin 27813
turned 27814
nearly 27815
white 27816
under 27817
his 27818
oil 27819
and 27820
smoke, 27821
for 27822
he 27823
was 27824
an 27825
Aleut, 27826
and 27827
Aleuts 27828
are 27829
not 27830
clean 27831
people. 27832
Then 27833
he 27834
began 27835
to 27836
mutter 27837
a 27838
prayer. 27839
“Don’t 27840
touch 27841
him, 27842
Patalamon. 27843
There 27844
has 27845
never 27846
been 27847
a 27848
white 27849
seal 27850
since--since 27851
I 27852
was 27853
born. 27854
Perhaps 27855
it 27856
is 27857
old 27858
Zaharrof’s 27859
ghost. 27860
He 27861
was 27862
lost 27863
last 27864
year 27865
in 27866
the 27867
big 27868
gale.” 27869
 27870
“I’m 27871
not 27872
going 27873
near 27874
him,” 27875
said 27876
Patalamon. 27877
“He’s 27878
unlucky. 27879
Do 27880
you 27881
really 27882
think 27883
he 27884
is 27885
old 27886
Zaharrof 27887
come 27888
back? 27889
I 27890
owe 27891
him 27892
for 27893
some 27894
gulls’ 27895
eggs.” 27896
 27897
“Don’t 27898
look 27899
at 27900
him,” 27901
said 27902
Kerick. 27903
“Head 27904
off 27905
that 27906
drove 27907
of 27908
four-year-olds. 27909
The 27910
men 27911
ought 27912
to 27913
skin 27914
two 27915
hundred 27916
to-day, 27917
but 27918
it’s 27919
the 27920
beginning 27921
of 27922
the 27923
season 27924
and 27925
they 27926
are 27927
new 27928
to 27929
the 27930
work. 27931
A 27932
hundred 27933
will 27934
do. 27935
Quick!” 27936
 27937
Patalamon 27938
rattled 27939
a 27940
pair 27941
of 27942
seal’s 27943
shoulder 27944
bones 27945
in 27946
front 27947
of 27948
a 27949
herd 27950
of 27951
holluschickie 27952
and 27953
they 27954
stopped 27955
dead, 27956
puffing 27957
and 27958
blowing. 27959
Then 27960
he 27961
stepped 27962
near 27963
and 27964
the 27965
seals 27966
began 27967
to 27968
move, 27969
and 27970
Kerick 27971
headed 27972
them 27973
inland, 27974
and 27975
they 27976
never 27977
tried 27978
to 27979
get 27980
back 27981
to 27982
their 27983
companions. 27984
Hundreds 27985
and 27986
hundreds 27987
of 27988
thousands 27989
of 27990
seals 27991
watched 27992
them 27993
being 27994
driven, 27995
but 27996
they 27997
went 27998
on 27999
playing 28000
just 28001
the 28002
same. 28003
Kotick 28004
was 28005
the 28006
only 28007
one 28008
who 28009
asked 28010
questions, 28011
and 28012
none 28013
of 28014
his 28015
companions 28016
could 28017
tell 28018
him 28019
anything, 28020
except 28021
that 28022
the 28023
men 28024
always 28025
drove 28026
seals 28027
in 28028
that 28029
way 28030
for 28031
six 28032
weeks 28033
or 28034
two 28035
months 28036
of 28037
every 28038
year. 28039
 28040
“I 28041
am 28042
going 28043
to 28044
follow,” 28045
he 28046
said, 28047
and 28048
his 28049
eyes 28050
nearly 28051
popped 28052
out 28053
of 28054
his 28055
head 28056
as 28057
he 28058
shuffled 28059
along 28060
in 28061
the 28062
wake 28063
of 28064
the 28065
herd. 28066
 28067
“The 28068
white 28069
seal 28070
is 28071
coming 28072
after 28073
us,” 28074
cried 28075
Patalamon. 28076
“That’s 28077
the 28078
first 28079
time 28080
a 28081
seal 28082
has 28083
ever 28084
come 28085
to 28086
the 28087
killing-grounds 28088
alone.” 28089
 28090
“Hsh! 28091
Don’t 28092
look 28093
behind 28094
you,” 28095
said 28096
Kerick. 28097
“It 28098
is 28099
Zaharrof’s 28100
ghost! 28101
I 28102
must 28103
speak 28104
to 28105
the 28106
priest 28107
about 28108
this.” 28109
 28110
The 28111
distance 28112
to 28113
the 28114
killing-grounds 28115
was 28116
only 28117
half 28118
a 28119
mile, 28120
but 28121
it 28122
took 28123
an 28124
hour 28125
to 28126
cover, 28127
because 28128
if 28129
the 28130
seals 28131
went 28132
too 28133
fast 28134
Kerick 28135
knew 28136
that 28137
they 28138
would 28139
get 28140
heated 28141
and 28142
then 28143
their 28144
fur 28145
would 28146
come 28147
off 28148
in 28149
patches 28150
when 28151
they 28152
were 28153
skinned. 28154
So 28155
they 28156
went 28157
on 28158
very 28159
slowly, 28160
past 28161
Sea 28162
Lion’s 28163
Neck, 28164
past 28165
Webster 28166
House, 28167
till 28168
they 28169
came 28170
to 28171
the 28172
Salt 28173
House 28174
just 28175
beyond 28176
the 28177
sight 28178
of 28179
the 28180
seals 28181
on 28182
the 28183
beach. 28184
Kotick 28185
followed, 28186
panting 28187
and 28188
wondering. 28189
He 28190
thought 28191
that 28192
he 28193
was 28194
at 28195
the 28196
world’s 28197
end, 28198
but 28199
the 28200
roar 28201
of 28202
the 28203
seal 28204
nurseries 28205
behind 28206
him 28207
sounded 28208
as 28209
loud 28210
as 28211
the 28212
roar 28213
of 28214
a 28215
train 28216
in 28217
a 28218
tunnel. 28219
Then 28220
Kerick 28221
sat 28222
down 28223
on 28224
the 28225
moss 28226
and 28227
pulled 28228
out 28229
a 28230
heavy 28231
pewter 28232
watch 28233
and 28234
let 28235
the 28236
drove 28237
cool 28238
off 28239
for 28240
thirty 28241
minutes, 28242
and 28243
Kotick 28244
could 28245
hear 28246
the 28247
fog-dew 28248
dripping 28249
off 28250
the 28251
brim 28252
of 28253
his 28254
cap. 28255
Then 28256
ten 28257
or 28258
twelve 28259
men, 28260
each 28261
with 28262
an 28263
iron-bound 28264
club 28265
three 28266
or 28267
four 28268
feet 28269
long, 28270
came 28271
up, 28272
and 28273
Kerick 28274
pointed 28275
out 28276
one 28277
or 28278
two 28279
of 28280
the 28281
drove 28282
that 28283
were 28284
bitten 28285
by 28286
their 28287
companions 28288
or 28289
too 28290
hot, 28291
and 28292
the 28293
men 28294
kicked 28295
those 28296
aside 28297
with 28298
their 28299
heavy 28300
boots 28301
made 28302
of 28303
the 28304
skin 28305
of 28306
a 28307
walrus’s 28308
throat, 28309
and 28310
then 28311
Kerick 28312
said, 28313
“Let 28314
go!” 28315
and 28316
then 28317
the 28318
men 28319
clubbed 28320
the 28321
seals 28322
on 28323
the 28324
head 28325
as 28326
fast 28327
as 28328
they 28329
could. 28330
 28331
Ten 28332
minutes 28333
later 28334
little 28335
Kotick 28336
did 28337
not 28338
recognize 28339
his 28340
friends 28341
any 28342
more, 28343
for 28344
their 28345
skins 28346
were 28347
ripped 28348
off 28349
from 28350
the 28351
nose 28352
to 28353
the 28354
hind 28355
flippers, 28356
whipped 28357
off 28358
and 28359
thrown 28360
down 28361
on 28362
the 28363
ground 28364
in 28365
a 28366
pile. 28367
That 28368
was 28369
enough 28370
for 28371
Kotick. 28372
He 28373
turned 28374
and 28375
galloped 28376
(a 28377
seal 28378
can 28379
gallop 28380
very 28381
swiftly 28382
for 28383
a 28384
short 28385
time) 28386
back 28387
to 28388
the 28389
sea; 28390
his 28391
little 28392
new 28393
mustache 28394
bristling 28395
with 28396
horror. 28397
At 28398
Sea 28399
Lion’s 28400
Neck, 28401
where 28402
the 28403
great 28404
sea 28405
lions 28406
sit 28407
on 28408
the 28409
edge 28410
of 28411
the 28412
surf, 28413
he 28414
flung 28415
himself 28416
flipper-overhead 28417
into 28418
the 28419
cool 28420
water 28421
and 28422
rocked 28423
there, 28424
gasping 28425
miserably. 28426
“What’s 28427
here?” 28428
said 28429
a 28430
sea 28431
lion 28432
gruffly, 28433
for 28434
as 28435
a 28436
rule 28437
the 28438
sea 28439
lions 28440
keep 28441
themselves 28442
to 28443
themselves. 28444
 28445
“Scoochnie! 28446
Ochen 28447
scoochnie!” 28448
(“I’m 28449
lonesome, 28450
very 28451
lonesome!”) 28452
said 28453
Kotick. 28454
“They’re 28455
killing 28456
all 28457
the 28458
holluschickie 28459
on 28460
all 28461
the 28462
beaches!” 28463
 28464
The 28465
Sea 28466
Lion 28467
turned 28468
his 28469
head 28470
inshore. 28471
“Nonsense!” 28472
he 28473
said. 28474
“Your 28475
friends 28476
are 28477
making 28478
as 28479
much 28480
noise 28481
as 28482
ever. 28483
You 28484
must 28485
have 28486
seen 28487
old 28488
Kerick 28489
polishing 28490
off 28491
a 28492
drove. 28493
He’s 28494
done 28495
that 28496
for 28497
thirty 28498
years.” 28499
 28500
“It’s 28501
horrible,” 28502
said 28503
Kotick, 28504
backing 28505
water 28506
as 28507
a 28508
wave 28509
went 28510
over 28511
him, 28512
and 28513
steadying 28514
himself 28515
with 28516
a 28517
screw 28518
stroke 28519
of 28520
his 28521
flippers 28522
that 28523
brought 28524
him 28525
all 28526
standing 28527
within 28528
three 28529
inches 28530
of 28531
a 28532
jagged 28533
edge 28534
of 28535
rock. 28536
 28537
“Well 28538
done 28539
for 28540
a 28541
yearling!” 28542
said 28543
the 28544
Sea 28545
Lion, 28546
who 28547
could 28548
appreciate 28549
good 28550
swimming. 28551
“I 28552
suppose 28553
it 28554
is 28555
rather 28556
awful 28557
from 28558
your 28559
way 28560
of 28561
looking 28562
at 28563
it, 28564
but 28565
if 28566
you 28567
seals 28568
will 28569
come 28570
here 28571
year 28572
after 28573
year, 28574
of 28575
course 28576
the 28577
men 28578
get 28579
to 28580
know 28581
of 28582
it, 28583
and 28584
unless 28585
you 28586
can 28587
find 28588
an 28589
island 28590
where 28591
no 28592
men 28593
ever 28594
come 28595
you 28596
will 28597
always 28598
be 28599
driven.” 28600
 28601
“Isn’t 28602
there 28603
any 28604
such 28605
island?” 28606
began 28607
Kotick. 28608
 28609
“I’ve 28610
followed 28611
the 28612
poltoos 28613
[the 28614
halibut] 28615
for 28616
twenty 28617
years, 28618
and 28619
I 28620
can’t 28621
say 28622
I’ve 28623
found 28624
it 28625
yet. 28626
But 28627
look 28628
here--you 28629
seem 28630
to 28631
have 28632
a 28633
fondness 28634
for 28635
talking 28636
to 28637
your 28638
betters--suppose 28639
you 28640
go 28641
to 28642
Walrus 28643
Islet 28644
and 28645
talk 28646
to 28647
Sea 28648
Vitch. 28649
He 28650
may 28651
know 28652
something. 28653
Don’t 28654
flounce 28655
off 28656
like 28657
that. 28658
It’s 28659
a 28660
six-mile 28661
swim, 28662
and 28663
if 28664
I 28665
were 28666
you 28667
I 28668
should 28669
haul 28670
out 28671
and 28672
take 28673
a 28674
nap 28675
first, 28676
little 28677
one.” 28678
 28679
Kotick 28680
thought 28681
that 28682
that 28683
was 28684
good 28685
advice, 28686
so 28687
he 28688
swam 28689
round 28690
to 28691
his 28692
own 28693
beach, 28694
hauled 28695
out, 28696
and 28697
slept 28698
for 28699
half 28700
an 28701
hour, 28702
twitching 28703
all 28704
over, 28705
as 28706
seals 28707
will. 28708
Then 28709
he 28710
headed 28711
straight 28712
for 28713
Walrus 28714
Islet, 28715
a 28716
little 28717
low 28718
sheet 28719
of 28720
rocky 28721
island 28722
almost 28723
due 28724
northeast 28725
from 28726
Novastoshnah, 28727
all 28728
ledges 28729
and 28730
rock 28731
and 28732
gulls’ 28733
nests, 28734
where 28735
the 28736
walrus 28737
herded 28738
by 28739
themselves. 28740
 28741
He 28742
landed 28743
close 28744
to 28745
old 28746
Sea 28747
Vitch--the 28748
big, 28749
ugly, 28750
bloated, 28751
pimpled, 28752
fat-necked, 28753
long-tusked 28754
walrus 28755
of 28756
the 28757
North 28758
Pacific, 28759
who 28760
has 28761
no 28762
manners 28763
except 28764
when 28765
he 28766
is 28767
asleep--as 28768
he 28769
was 28770
then, 28771
with 28772
his 28773
hind 28774
flippers 28775
half 28776
in 28777
and 28778
half 28779
out 28780
of 28781
the 28782
surf. 28783
 28784
“Wake 28785
up!” 28786
barked 28787
Kotick, 28788
for 28789
the 28790
gulls 28791
were 28792
making 28793
a 28794
great 28795
noise. 28796
 28797
“Hah! 28798
Ho! 28799
Hmph! 28800
What’s 28801
that?” 28802
said 28803
Sea 28804
Vitch, 28805
and 28806
he 28807
struck 28808
the 28809
next 28810
walrus 28811
a 28812
blow 28813
with 28814
his 28815
tusks 28816
and 28817
waked 28818
him 28819
up, 28820
and 28821
the 28822
next 28823
struck 28824
the 28825
next, 28826
and 28827
so 28828
on 28829
till 28830
they 28831
were 28832
all 28833
awake 28834
and 28835
staring 28836
in 28837
every 28838
direction 28839
but 28840
the 28841
right 28842
one. 28843
 28844
“Hi! 28845
It’s 28846
me,” 28847
said 28848
Kotick, 28849
bobbing 28850
in 28851
the 28852
surf 28853
and 28854
looking 28855
like 28856
a 28857
little 28858
white 28859
slug. 28860
 28861
“Well! 28862
May 28863
I 28864
be--skinned!” 28865
said 28866
Sea 28867
Vitch, 28868
and 28869
they 28870
all 28871
looked 28872
at 28873
Kotick 28874
as 28875
you 28876
can 28877
fancy 28878
a 28879
club 28880
full 28881
of 28882
drowsy 28883
old 28884
gentlemen 28885
would 28886
look 28887
at 28888
a 28889
little 28890
boy. 28891
Kotick 28892
did 28893
not 28894
care 28895
to 28896
hear 28897
any 28898
more 28899
about 28900
skinning 28901
just 28902
then; 28903
he 28904
had 28905
seen 28906
enough 28907
of 28908
it. 28909
So 28910
he 28911
called 28912
out: 28913
“Isn’t 28914
there 28915
any 28916
place 28917
for 28918
seals 28919
to 28920
go 28921
where 28922
men 28923
don’t 28924
ever 28925
come?” 28926
 28927
“Go 28928
and 28929
find 28930
out,” 28931
said 28932
Sea 28933
Vitch, 28934
shutting 28935
his 28936
eyes. 28937
“Run 28938
away. 28939
We’re 28940
busy 28941
here.” 28942
 28943
Kotick 28944
made 28945
his 28946
dolphin-jump 28947
in 28948
the 28949
air 28950
and 28951
shouted 28952
as 28953
loud 28954
as 28955
he 28956
could: 28957
“Clam-eater! 28958
Clam-eater!” 28959
He 28960
knew 28961
that 28962
Sea 28963
Vitch 28964
never 28965
caught 28966
a 28967
fish 28968
in 28969
his 28970
life 28971
but 28972
always 28973
rooted 28974
for 28975
clams 28976
and 28977
seaweed; 28978
though 28979
he 28980
pretended 28981
to 28982
be 28983
a 28984
very 28985
terrible 28986
person. 28987
Naturally 28988
the 28989
Chickies 28990
and 28991
the 28992
Gooverooskies 28993
and 28994
the 28995
Epatkas--the 28996
Burgomaster 28997
Gulls 28998
and 28999
the 29000
Kittiwakes 29001
and 29002
the 29003
Puffins, 29004
who 29005
are 29006
always 29007
looking 29008
for 29009
a 29010
chance 29011
to 29012
be 29013
rude, 29014
took 29015
up 29016
the 29017
cry, 29018
and--so 29019
Limmershin 29020
told 29021
me--for 29022
nearly 29023
five 29024
minutes 29025
you 29026
could 29027
not 29028
have 29029
heard 29030
a 29031
gun 29032
fired 29033
on 29034
Walrus 29035
Islet. 29036
All 29037
the 29038
population 29039
was 29040
yelling 29041
and 29042
screaming 29043
“Clam-eater! 29044
Stareek 29045
[old 29046
man]!” 29047
while 29048
Sea 29049
Vitch 29050
rolled 29051
from 29052
side 29053
to 29054
side 29055
grunting 29056
and 29057
coughing. 29058
 29059
“Now 29060
will 29061
you 29062
tell?” 29063
said 29064
Kotick, 29065
all 29066
out 29067
of 29068
breath. 29069
 29070
“Go 29071
and 29072
ask 29073
Sea 29074
Cow,” 29075
said 29076
Sea 29077
Vitch. 29078
“If 29079
he 29080
is 29081
living 29082
still, 29083
he’ll 29084
be 29085
able 29086
to 29087
tell 29088
you.” 29089
 29090
“How 29091
shall 29092
I 29093
know 29094
Sea 29095
Cow 29096
when 29097
I 29098
meet 29099
him?” 29100
said 29101
Kotick, 29102
sheering 29103
off. 29104
 29105
“He’s 29106
the 29107
only 29108
thing 29109
in 29110
the 29111
sea 29112
uglier 29113
than 29114
Sea 29115
Vitch,” 29116
screamed 29117
a 29118
Burgomaster 29119
gull, 29120
wheeling 29121
under 29122
Sea 29123
Vitch’s 29124
nose. 29125
“Uglier, 29126
and 29127
with 29128
worse 29129
manners! 29130
Stareek!” 29131
 29132
Kotick 29133
swam 29134
back 29135
to 29136
Novastoshnah, 29137
leaving 29138
the 29139
gulls 29140
to 29141
scream. 29142
There 29143
he 29144
found 29145
that 29146
no 29147
one 29148
sympathized 29149
with 29150
him 29151
in 29152
his 29153
little 29154
attempt 29155
to 29156
discover 29157
a 29158
quiet 29159
place 29160
for 29161
the 29162
seals. 29163
They 29164
told 29165
him 29166
that 29167
men 29168
had 29169
always 29170
driven 29171
the 29172
holluschickie--it 29173
was 29174
part 29175
of 29176
the 29177
day’s 29178
work--and 29179
that 29180
if 29181
he 29182
did 29183
not 29184
like 29185
to 29186
see 29187
ugly 29188
things 29189
he 29190
should 29191
not 29192
have 29193
gone 29194
to 29195
the 29196
killing 29197
grounds. 29198
But 29199
none 29200
of 29201
the 29202
other 29203
seals 29204
had 29205
seen 29206
the 29207
killing, 29208
and 29209
that 29210
made 29211
the 29212
difference 29213
between 29214
him 29215
and 29216
his 29217
friends. 29218
Besides, 29219
Kotick 29220
was 29221
a 29222
white 29223
seal. 29224
 29225
“What 29226
you 29227
must 29228
do,” 29229
said 29230
old 29231
Sea 29232
Catch, 29233
after 29234
he 29235
had 29236
heard 29237
his 29238
son’s 29239
adventures, 29240
“is 29241
to 29242
grow 29243
up 29244
and 29245
be 29246
a 29247
big 29248
seal 29249
like 29250
your 29251
father, 29252
and 29253
have 29254
a 29255
nursery 29256
on 29257
the 29258
beach, 29259
and 29260
then 29261
they 29262
will 29263
leave 29264
you 29265
alone. 29266
In 29267
another 29268
five 29269
years 29270
you 29271
ought 29272
to 29273
be 29274
able 29275
to 29276
fight 29277
for 29278
yourself.” 29279
Even 29280
gentle 29281
Matkah, 29282
his 29283
mother, 29284
said: 29285
“You 29286
will 29287
never 29288
be 29289
able 29290
to 29291
stop 29292
the 29293
killing. 29294
Go 29295
and 29296
play 29297
in 29298
the 29299
sea, 29300
Kotick.” 29301
And 29302
Kotick 29303
went 29304
off 29305
and 29306
danced 29307
the 29308
Fire-dance 29309
with 29310
a 29311
very 29312
heavy 29313
little 29314
heart. 29315
 29316
That 29317
autumn 29318
he 29319
left 29320
the 29321
beach 29322
as 29323
soon 29324
as 29325
he 29326
could, 29327
and 29328
set 29329
off 29330
alone 29331
because 29332
of 29333
a 29334
notion 29335
in 29336
his 29337
bullet-head. 29338
He 29339
was 29340
going 29341
to 29342
find 29343
Sea 29344
Cow, 29345
if 29346
there 29347
was 29348
such 29349
a 29350
person 29351
in 29352
the 29353
sea, 29354
and 29355
he 29356
was 29357
going 29358
to 29359
find 29360
a 29361
quiet 29362
island 29363
with 29364
good 29365
firm 29366
beaches 29367
for 29368
seals 29369
to 29370
live 29371
on, 29372
where 29373
men 29374
could 29375
not 29376
get 29377
at 29378
them. 29379
So 29380
he 29381
explored 29382
and 29383
explored 29384
by 29385
himself 29386
from 29387
the 29388
North 29389
to 29390
the 29391
South 29392
Pacific, 29393
swimming 29394
as 29395
much 29396
as 29397
three 29398
hundred 29399
miles 29400
in 29401
a 29402
day 29403
and 29404
a 29405
night. 29406
He 29407
met 29408
with 29409
more 29410
adventures 29411
than 29412
can 29413
be 29414
told, 29415
and 29416
narrowly 29417
escaped 29418
being 29419
caught 29420
by 29421
the 29422
Basking 29423
Shark, 29424
and 29425
the 29426
Spotted 29427
Shark, 29428
and 29429
the 29430
Hammerhead, 29431
and 29432
he 29433
met 29434
all 29435
the 29436
untrustworthy 29437
ruffians 29438
that 29439
loaf 29440
up 29441
and 29442
down 29443
the 29444
seas, 29445
and 29446
the 29447
heavy 29448
polite 29449
fish, 29450
and 29451
the 29452
scarlet 29453
spotted 29454
scallops 29455
that 29456
are 29457
moored 29458
in 29459
one 29460
place 29461
for 29462
hundreds 29463
of 29464
years, 29465
and 29466
grow 29467
very 29468
proud 29469
of 29470
it; 29471
but 29472
he 29473
never 29474
met 29475
Sea 29476
Cow, 29477
and 29478
he 29479
never 29480
found 29481
an 29482
island 29483
that 29484
he 29485
could 29486
fancy. 29487
 29488
If 29489
the 29490
beach 29491
was 29492
good 29493
and 29494
hard, 29495
with 29496
a 29497
slope 29498
behind 29499
it 29500
for 29501
seals 29502
to 29503
play 29504
on, 29505
there 29506
was 29507
always 29508
the 29509
smoke 29510
of 29511
a 29512
whaler 29513
on 29514
the 29515
horizon, 29516
boiling 29517
down 29518
blubber, 29519
and 29520
Kotick 29521
knew 29522
what 29523
that 29524
meant. 29525
Or 29526
else 29527
he 29528
could 29529
see 29530
that 29531
seals 29532
had 29533
once 29534
visited 29535
the 29536
island 29537
and 29538
been 29539
killed 29540
off, 29541
and 29542
Kotick 29543
knew 29544
that 29545
where 29546
men 29547
had 29548
come 29549
once 29550
they 29551
would 29552
come 29553
again. 29554
 29555
He 29556
picked 29557
up 29558
with 29559
an 29560
old 29561
stumpy-tailed 29562
albatross, 29563
who 29564
told 29565
him 29566
that 29567
Kerguelen 29568
Island 29569
was 29570
the 29571
very 29572
place 29573
for 29574
peace 29575
and 29576
quiet, 29577
and 29578
when 29579
Kotick 29580
went 29581
down 29582
there 29583
he 29584
was 29585
all 29586
but 29587
smashed 29588
to 29589
pieces 29590
against 29591
some 29592
wicked 29593
black 29594
cliffs 29595
in 29596
a 29597
heavy 29598
sleet-storm 29599
with 29600
lightning 29601
and 29602
thunder. 29603
Yet 29604
as 29605
he 29606
pulled 29607
out 29608
against 29609
the 29610
gale 29611
he 29612
could 29613
see 29614
that 29615
even 29616
there 29617
had 29618
once 29619
been 29620
a 29621
seal 29622
nursery. 29623
And 29624
it 29625
was 29626
so 29627
in 29628
all 29629
the 29630
other 29631
islands 29632
that 29633
he 29634
visited. 29635
 29636
Limmershin 29637
gave 29638
a 29639
long 29640
list 29641
of 29642
them, 29643
for 29644
he 29645
said 29646
that 29647
Kotick 29648
spent 29649
five 29650
seasons 29651
exploring, 29652
with 29653
a 29654
four 29655
months’ 29656
rest 29657
each 29658
year 29659
at 29660
Novastoshnah, 29661
when 29662
the 29663
holluschickie 29664
used 29665
to 29666
make 29667
fun 29668
of 29669
him 29670
and 29671
his 29672
imaginary 29673
islands. 29674
He 29675
went 29676
to 29677
the 29678
Gallapagos, 29679
a 29680
horrid 29681
dry 29682
place 29683
on 29684
the 29685
Equator, 29686
where 29687
he 29688
was 29689
nearly 29690
baked 29691
to 29692
death; 29693
he 29694
went 29695
to 29696
the 29697
Georgia 29698
Islands, 29699
the 29700
Orkneys, 29701
Emerald 29702
Island, 29703
Little 29704
Nightingale 29705
Island, 29706
Gough’s 29707
Island, 29708
Bouvet’s 29709
Island, 29710
the 29711
Crossets, 29712
and 29713
even 29714
to 29715
a 29716
little 29717
speck 29718
of 29719
an 29720
island 29721
south 29722
of 29723
the 29724
Cape 29725
of 29726
Good 29727
Hope. 29728
But 29729
everywhere 29730
the 29731
People 29732
of 29733
the 29734
Sea 29735
told 29736
him 29737
the 29738
same 29739
things. 29740
Seals 29741
had 29742
come 29743
to 29744
those 29745
islands 29746
once 29747
upon 29748
a 29749
time, 29750
but 29751
men 29752
had 29753
killed 29754
them 29755
all 29756
off. 29757
Even 29758
when 29759
he 29760
swam 29761
thousands 29762
of 29763
miles 29764
out 29765
of 29766
the 29767
Pacific 29768
and 29769
got 29770
to 29771
a 29772
place 29773
called 29774
Cape 29775
Corrientes 29776
(that 29777
was 29778
when 29779
he 29780
was 29781
coming 29782
back 29783
from 29784
Gough’s 29785
Island), 29786
he 29787
found 29788
a 29789
few 29790
hundred 29791
mangy 29792
seals 29793
on 29794
a 29795
rock 29796
and 29797
they 29798
told 29799
him 29800
that 29801
men 29802
came 29803
there 29804
too. 29805
 29806
That 29807
nearly 29808
broke 29809
his 29810
heart, 29811
and 29812
he 29813
headed 29814
round 29815
the 29816
Horn 29817
back 29818
to 29819
his 29820
own 29821
beaches; 29822
and 29823
on 29824
his 29825
way 29826
north 29827
he 29828
hauled 29829
out 29830
on 29831
an 29832
island 29833
full 29834
of 29835
green 29836
trees, 29837
where 29838
he 29839
found 29840
an 29841
old, 29842
old 29843
seal 29844
who 29845
was 29846
dying, 29847
and 29848
Kotick 29849
caught 29850
fish 29851
for 29852
him 29853
and 29854
told 29855
him 29856
all 29857
his 29858
sorrows. 29859
“Now,” 29860
said 29861
Kotick, 29862
“I 29863
am 29864
going 29865
back 29866
to 29867
Novastoshnah, 29868
and 29869
if 29870
I 29871
am 29872
driven 29873
to 29874
the 29875
killing-pens 29876
with 29877
the 29878
holluschickie 29879
I 29880
shall 29881
not 29882
care.” 29883
 29884
The 29885
old 29886
seal 29887
said, 29888
“Try 29889
once 29890
more. 29891
I 29892
am 29893
the 29894
last 29895
of 29896
the 29897
Lost 29898
Rookery 29899
of 29900
Masafuera, 29901
and 29902
in 29903
the 29904
days 29905
when 29906
men 29907
killed 29908
us 29909
by 29910
the 29911
hundred 29912
thousand 29913
there 29914
was 29915
a 29916
story 29917
on 29918
the 29919
beaches 29920
that 29921
some 29922
day 29923
a 29924
white 29925
seal 29926
would 29927
come 29928
out 29929
of 29930
the 29931
North 29932
and 29933
lead 29934
the 29935
seal 29936
people 29937
to 29938
a 29939
quiet 29940
place. 29941
I 29942
am 29943
old, 29944
and 29945
I 29946
shall 29947
never 29948
live 29949
to 29950
see 29951
that 29952
day, 29953
but 29954
others 29955
will. 29956
Try 29957
once 29958
more.” 29959
 29960
And 29961
Kotick 29962
curled 29963
up 29964
his 29965
mustache 29966
(it 29967
was 29968
a 29969
beauty) 29970
and 29971
said, 29972
“I 29973
am 29974
the 29975
only 29976
white 29977
seal 29978
that 29979
has 29980
ever 29981
been 29982
born 29983
on 29984
the 29985
beaches, 29986
and 29987
I 29988
am 29989
the 29990
only 29991
seal, 29992
black 29993
or 29994
white, 29995
who 29996
ever 29997
thought 29998
of 29999
looking 30000
for 30001
new 30002
islands.” 30003
 30004
This 30005
cheered 30006
him 30007
immensely; 30008
and 30009
when 30010
he 30011
came 30012
back 30013
to 30014
Novastoshnah 30015
that 30016
summer, 30017
Matkah, 30018
his 30019
mother, 30020
begged 30021
him 30022
to 30023
marry 30024
and 30025
settle 30026
down, 30027
for 30028
he 30029
was 30030
no 30031
longer 30032
a 30033
holluschick 30034
but 30035
a 30036
full-grown 30037
sea-catch, 30038
with 30039
a 30040
curly 30041
white 30042
mane 30043
on 30044
his 30045
shoulders, 30046
as 30047
heavy, 30048
as 30049
big, 30050
and 30051
as 30052
fierce 30053
as 30054
his 30055
father. 30056
“Give 30057
me 30058
another 30059
season,” 30060
he 30061
said. 30062
“Remember, 30063
Mother, 30064
it 30065
is 30066
always 30067
the 30068
seventh 30069
wave 30070
that 30071
goes 30072
farthest 30073
up 30074
the 30075
beach.” 30076
 30077
Curiously 30078
enough, 30079
there 30080
was 30081
another 30082
seal 30083
who 30084
thought 30085
that 30086
she 30087
would 30088
put 30089
off 30090
marrying 30091
till 30092
the 30093
next 30094
year, 30095
and 30096
Kotick 30097
danced 30098
the 30099
Fire-dance 30100
with 30101
her 30102
all 30103
down 30104
Lukannon 30105
Beach 30106
the 30107
night 30108
before 30109
he 30110
set 30111
off 30112
on 30113
his 30114
last 30115
exploration. 30116
This 30117
time 30118
he 30119
went 30120
westward, 30121
because 30122
he 30123
had 30124
fallen 30125
on 30126
the 30127
trail 30128
of 30129
a 30130
great 30131
shoal 30132
of 30133
halibut, 30134
and 30135
he 30136
needed 30137
at 30138
least 30139
one 30140
hundred 30141
pounds 30142
of 30143
fish 30144
a 30145
day 30146
to 30147
keep 30148
him 30149
in 30150
good 30151
condition. 30152
He 30153
chased 30154
them 30155
till 30156
he 30157
was 30158
tired, 30159
and 30160
then 30161
he 30162
curled 30163
himself 30164
up 30165
and 30166
went 30167
to 30168
sleep 30169
on 30170
the 30171
hollows 30172
of 30173
the 30174
ground 30175
swell 30176
that 30177
sets 30178
in 30179
to 30180
Copper 30181
Island. 30182
He 30183
knew 30184
the 30185
coast 30186
perfectly 30187
well, 30188
so 30189
about 30190
midnight, 30191
when 30192
he 30193
felt 30194
himself 30195
gently 30196
bumped 30197
on 30198
a 30199
weed-bed, 30200
he 30201
said, 30202
“Hm, 30203
tide’s 30204
running 30205
strong 30206
tonight,” 30207
and 30208
turning 30209
over 30210
under 30211
water 30212
opened 30213
his 30214
eyes 30215
slowly 30216
and 30217
stretched. 30218
Then 30219
he 30220
jumped 30221
like 30222
a 30223
cat, 30224
for 30225
he 30226
saw 30227
huge 30228
things 30229
nosing 30230
about 30231
in 30232
the 30233
shoal 30234
water 30235
and 30236
browsing 30237
on 30238
the 30239
heavy 30240
fringes 30241
of 30242
the 30243
weeds. 30244
 30245
“By 30246
the 30247
Great 30248
Combers 30249
of 30250
Magellan!” 30251
he 30252
said, 30253
beneath 30254
his 30255
mustache. 30256
“Who 30257
in 30258
the 30259
Deep 30260
Sea 30261
are 30262
these 30263
people?” 30264
 30265
They 30266
were 30267
like 30268
no 30269
walrus, 30270
sea 30271
lion, 30272
seal, 30273
bear, 30274
whale, 30275
shark, 30276
fish, 30277
squid, 30278
or 30279
scallop 30280
that 30281
Kotick 30282
had 30283
ever 30284
seen 30285
before. 30286
They 30287
were 30288
between 30289
twenty 30290
and 30291
thirty 30292
feet 30293
long, 30294
and 30295
they 30296
had 30297
no 30298
hind 30299
flippers, 30300
but 30301
a 30302
shovel-like 30303
tail 30304
that 30305
looked 30306
as 30307
if 30308
it 30309
had 30310
been 30311
whittled 30312
out 30313
of 30314
wet 30315
leather. 30316
Their 30317
heads 30318
were 30319
the 30320
most 30321
foolish-looking 30322
things 30323
you 30324
ever 30325
saw, 30326
and 30327
they 30328
balanced 30329
on 30330
the 30331
ends 30332
of 30333
their 30334
tails 30335
in 30336
deep 30337
water 30338
when 30339
they 30340
weren’t 30341
grazing, 30342
bowing 30343
solemnly 30344
to 30345
each 30346
other 30347
and 30348
waving 30349
their 30350
front 30351
flippers 30352
as 30353
a 30354
fat 30355
man 30356
waves 30357
his 30358
arm. 30359
 30360
“Ahem!” 30361
said 30362
Kotick. 30363
“Good 30364
sport, 30365
gentlemen?” 30366
The 30367
big 30368
things 30369
answered 30370
by 30371
bowing 30372
and 30373
waving 30374
their 30375
flippers 30376
like 30377
the 30378
Frog 30379
Footman. 30380
When 30381
they 30382
began 30383
feeding 30384
again 30385
Kotick 30386
saw 30387
that 30388
their 30389
upper 30390
lip 30391
was 30392
split 30393
into 30394
two 30395
pieces 30396
that 30397
they 30398
could 30399
twitch 30400
apart 30401
about 30402
a 30403
foot 30404
and 30405
bring 30406
together 30407
again 30408
with 30409
a 30410
whole 30411
bushel 30412
of 30413
seaweed 30414
between 30415
the 30416
splits. 30417
They 30418
tucked 30419
the 30420
stuff 30421
into 30422
their 30423
mouths 30424
and 30425
chumped 30426
solemnly. 30427
 30428
“Messy 30429
style 30430
of 30431
feeding, 30432
that,” 30433
said 30434
Kotick. 30435
They 30436
bowed 30437
again, 30438
and 30439
Kotick 30440
began 30441
to 30442
lose 30443
his 30444
temper. 30445
“Very 30446
good,” 30447
he 30448
said. 30449
“If 30450
you 30451
do 30452
happen 30453
to 30454
have 30455
an 30456
extra 30457
joint 30458
in 30459
your 30460
front 30461
flipper 30462
you 30463
needn’t 30464
show 30465
off 30466
so. 30467
I 30468
see 30469
you 30470
bow 30471
gracefully, 30472
but 30473
I 30474
should 30475
like 30476
to 30477
know 30478
your 30479
names.” 30480
The 30481
split 30482
lips 30483
moved 30484
and 30485
twitched; 30486
and 30487
the 30488
glassy 30489
green 30490
eyes 30491
stared, 30492
but 30493
they 30494
did 30495
not 30496
speak. 30497
 30498
“Well!” 30499
said 30500
Kotick. 30501
“You’re 30502
the 30503
only 30504
people 30505
I’ve 30506
ever 30507
met 30508
uglier 30509
than 30510
Sea 30511
Vitch--and 30512
with 30513
worse 30514
manners.” 30515
 30516
Then 30517
he 30518
remembered 30519
in 30520
a 30521
flash 30522
what 30523
the 30524
Burgomaster 30525
gull 30526
had 30527
screamed 30528
to 30529
him 30530
when 30531
he 30532
was 30533
a 30534
little 30535
yearling 30536
at 30537
Walrus 30538
Islet, 30539
and 30540
he 30541
tumbled 30542
backward 30543
in 30544
the 30545
water, 30546
for 30547
he 30548
knew 30549
that 30550
he 30551
had 30552
found 30553
Sea 30554
Cow 30555
at 30556
last. 30557
 30558
The 30559
sea 30560
cows 30561
went 30562
on 30563
schlooping 30564
and 30565
grazing 30566
and 30567
chumping 30568
in 30569
the 30570
weed, 30571
and 30572
Kotick 30573
asked 30574
them 30575
questions 30576
in 30577
every 30578
language 30579
that 30580
he 30581
had 30582
picked 30583
up 30584
in 30585
his 30586
travels; 30587
and 30588
the 30589
Sea 30590
People 30591
talk 30592
nearly 30593
as 30594
many 30595
languages 30596
as 30597
human 30598
beings. 30599
But 30600
the 30601
sea 30602
cows 30603
did 30604
not 30605
answer 30606
because 30607
Sea 30608
Cow 30609
cannot 30610
talk. 30611
He 30612
has 30613
only 30614
six 30615
bones 30616
in 30617
his 30618
neck 30619
where 30620
he 30621
ought 30622
to 30623
have 30624
seven, 30625
and 30626
they 30627
say 30628
under 30629
the 30630
sea 30631
that 30632
that 30633
prevents 30634
him 30635
from 30636
speaking 30637
even 30638
to 30639
his 30640
companions. 30641
But, 30642
as 30643
you 30644
know, 30645
he 30646
has 30647
an 30648
extra 30649
joint 30650
in 30651
his 30652
foreflipper, 30653
and 30654
by 30655
waving 30656
it 30657
up 30658
and 30659
down 30660
and 30661
about 30662
he 30663
makes 30664
what 30665
answers 30666
to 30667
a 30668
sort 30669
of 30670
clumsy 30671
telegraphic 30672
code. 30673
 30674
By 30675
daylight 30676
Kotick’s 30677
mane 30678
was 30679
standing 30680
on 30681
end 30682
and 30683
his 30684
temper 30685
was 30686
gone 30687
where 30688
the 30689
dead 30690
crabs 30691
go. 30692
Then 30693
the 30694
Sea 30695
Cow 30696
began 30697
to 30698
travel 30699
northward 30700
very 30701
slowly, 30702
stopping 30703
to 30704
hold 30705
absurd 30706
bowing 30707
councils 30708
from 30709
time 30710
to 30711
time, 30712
and 30713
Kotick 30714
followed 30715
them, 30716
saying 30717
to 30718
himself, 30719
“People 30720
who 30721
are 30722
such 30723
idiots 30724
as 30725
these 30726
are 30727
would 30728
have 30729
been 30730
killed 30731
long 30732
ago 30733
if 30734
they 30735
hadn’t 30736
found 30737
out 30738
some 30739
safe 30740
island. 30741
And 30742
what 30743
is 30744
good 30745
enough 30746
for 30747
the 30748
Sea 30749
Cow 30750
is 30751
good 30752
enough 30753
for 30754
the 30755
Sea 30756
Catch. 30757
All 30758
the 30759
same, 30760
I 30761
wish 30762
they’d 30763
hurry.” 30764
 30765
It 30766
was 30767
weary 30768
work 30769
for 30770
Kotick. 30771
The 30772
herd 30773
never 30774
went 30775
more 30776
than 30777
forty 30778
or 30779
fifty 30780
miles 30781
a 30782
day, 30783
and 30784
stopped 30785
to 30786
feed 30787
at 30788
night, 30789
and 30790
kept 30791
close 30792
to 30793
the 30794
shore 30795
all 30796
the 30797
time; 30798
while 30799
Kotick 30800
swam 30801
round 30802
them, 30803
and 30804
over 30805
them, 30806
and 30807
under 30808
them, 30809
but 30810
he 30811
could 30812
not 30813
hurry 30814
them 30815
up 30816
one-half 30817
mile. 30818
As 30819
they 30820
went 30821
farther 30822
north 30823
they 30824
held 30825
a 30826
bowing 30827
council 30828
every 30829
few 30830
hours, 30831
and 30832
Kotick 30833
nearly 30834
bit 30835
off 30836
his 30837
mustache 30838
with 30839
impatience 30840
till 30841
he 30842
saw 30843
that 30844
they 30845
were 30846
following 30847
up 30848
a 30849
warm 30850
current 30851
of 30852
water, 30853
and 30854
then 30855
he 30856
respected 30857
them 30858
more. 30859
 30860
One 30861
night 30862
they 30863
sank 30864
through 30865
the 30866
shiny 30867
water--sank 30868
like 30869
stones--and 30870
for 30871
the 30872
first 30873
time 30874
since 30875
he 30876
had 30877
known 30878
them 30879
began 30880
to 30881
swim 30882
quickly. 30883
Kotick 30884
followed, 30885
and 30886
the 30887
pace 30888
astonished 30889
him, 30890
for 30891
he 30892
never 30893
dreamed 30894
that 30895
Sea 30896
Cow 30897
was 30898
anything 30899
of 30900
a 30901
swimmer. 30902
They 30903
headed 30904
for 30905
a 30906
cliff 30907
by 30908
the 30909
shore--a 30910
cliff 30911
that 30912
ran 30913
down 30914
into 30915
deep 30916
water, 30917
and 30918
plunged 30919
into 30920
a 30921
dark 30922
hole 30923
at 30924
the 30925
foot 30926
of 30927
it, 30928
twenty 30929
fathoms 30930
under 30931
the 30932
sea. 30933
It 30934
was 30935
a 30936
long, 30937
long 30938
swim, 30939
and 30940
Kotick 30941
badly 30942
wanted 30943
fresh 30944
air 30945
before 30946
he 30947
was 30948
out 30949
of 30950
the 30951
dark 30952
tunnel 30953
they 30954
led 30955
him 30956
through. 30957
 30958
“My 30959
wig!” 30960
he 30961
said, 30962
when 30963
he 30964
rose, 30965
gasping 30966
and 30967
puffing, 30968
into 30969
open 30970
water 30971
at 30972
the 30973
farther 30974
end. 30975
“It 30976
was 30977
a 30978
long 30979
dive, 30980
but 30981
it 30982
was 30983
worth 30984
it.” 30985
 30986
The 30987
sea 30988
cows 30989
had 30990
separated 30991
and 30992
were 30993
browsing 30994
lazily 30995
along 30996
the 30997
edges 30998
of 30999
the 31000
finest 31001
beaches 31002
that 31003
Kotick 31004
had 31005
ever 31006
seen. 31007
There 31008
were 31009
long 31010
stretches 31011
of 31012
smooth-worn 31013
rock 31014
running 31015
for 31016
miles, 31017
exactly 31018
fitted 31019
to 31020
make 31021
seal-nurseries, 31022
and 31023
there 31024
were 31025
play-grounds 31026
of 31027
hard 31028
sand 31029
sloping 31030
inland 31031
behind 31032
them, 31033
and 31034
there 31035
were 31036
rollers 31037
for 31038
seals 31039
to 31040
dance 31041
in, 31042
and 31043
long 31044
grass 31045
to 31046
roll 31047
in, 31048
and 31049
sand 31050
dunes 31051
to 31052
climb 31053
up 31054
and 31055
down, 31056
and, 31057
best 31058
of 31059
all, 31060
Kotick 31061
knew 31062
by 31063
the 31064
feel 31065
of 31066
the 31067
water, 31068
which 31069
never 31070
deceives 31071
a 31072
true 31073
sea 31074
catch, 31075
that 31076
no 31077
men 31078
had 31079
ever 31080
come 31081
there. 31082
 31083
The 31084
first 31085
thing 31086
he 31087
did 31088
was 31089
to 31090
assure 31091
himself 31092
that 31093
the 31094
fishing 31095
was 31096
good, 31097
and 31098
then 31099
he 31100
swam 31101
along 31102
the 31103
beaches 31104
and 31105
counted 31106
up 31107
the 31108
delightful 31109
low 31110
sandy 31111
islands 31112
half 31113
hidden 31114
in 31115
the 31116
beautiful 31117
rolling 31118
fog. 31119
Away 31120
to 31121
the 31122
northward, 31123
out 31124
to 31125
sea, 31126
ran 31127
a 31128
line 31129
of 31130
bars 31131
and 31132
shoals 31133
and 31134
rocks 31135
that 31136
would 31137
never 31138
let 31139
a 31140
ship 31141
come 31142
within 31143
six 31144
miles 31145
of 31146
the 31147
beach, 31148
and 31149
between 31150
the 31151
islands 31152
and 31153
the 31154
mainland 31155
was 31156
a 31157
stretch 31158
of 31159
deep 31160
water 31161
that 31162
ran 31163
up 31164
to 31165
the 31166
perpendicular 31167
cliffs, 31168
and 31169
somewhere 31170
below 31171
the 31172
cliffs 31173
was 31174
the 31175
mouth 31176
of 31177
the 31178
tunnel. 31179
 31180
“It’s 31181
Novastoshnah 31182
over 31183
again, 31184
but 31185
ten 31186
times 31187
better,” 31188
said 31189
Kotick. 31190
“Sea 31191
Cow 31192
must 31193
be 31194
wiser 31195
than 31196
I 31197
thought. 31198
Men 31199
can’t 31200
come 31201
down 31202
the 31203
cliffs, 31204
even 31205
if 31206
there 31207
were 31208
any 31209
men; 31210
and 31211
the 31212
shoals 31213
to 31214
seaward 31215
would 31216
knock 31217
a 31218
ship 31219
to 31220
splinters. 31221
If 31222
any 31223
place 31224
in 31225
the 31226
sea 31227
is 31228
safe, 31229
this 31230
is 31231
it.” 31232
 31233
He 31234
began 31235
to 31236
think 31237
of 31238
the 31239
seal 31240
he 31241
had 31242
left 31243
behind 31244
him, 31245
but 31246
though 31247
he 31248
was 31249
in 31250
a 31251
hurry 31252
to 31253
go 31254
back 31255
to 31256
Novastoshnah, 31257
he 31258
thoroughly 31259
explored 31260
the 31261
new 31262
country, 31263
so 31264
that 31265
he 31266
would 31267
be 31268
able 31269
to 31270
answer 31271
all 31272
questions. 31273
 31274
Then 31275
he 31276
dived 31277
and 31278
made 31279
sure 31280
of 31281
the 31282
mouth 31283
of 31284
the 31285
tunnel, 31286
and 31287
raced 31288
through 31289
to 31290
the 31291
southward. 31292
No 31293
one 31294
but 31295
a 31296
sea 31297
cow 31298
or 31299
a 31300
seal 31301
would 31302
have 31303
dreamed 31304
of 31305
there 31306
being 31307
such 31308
a 31309
place, 31310
and 31311
when 31312
he 31313
looked 31314
back 31315
at 31316
the 31317
cliffs 31318
even 31319
Kotick 31320
could 31321
hardly 31322
believe 31323
that 31324
he 31325
had 31326
been 31327
under 31328
them. 31329
 31330
He 31331
was 31332
six 31333
days 31334
going 31335
home, 31336
though 31337
he 31338
was 31339
not 31340
swimming 31341
slowly; 31342
and 31343
when 31344
he 31345
hauled 31346
out 31347
just 31348
above 31349
Sea 31350
Lion’s 31351
Neck 31352
the 31353
first 31354
person 31355
he 31356
met 31357
was 31358
the 31359
seal 31360
who 31361
had 31362
been 31363
waiting 31364
for 31365
him, 31366
and 31367
she 31368
saw 31369
by 31370
the 31371
look 31372
in 31373
his 31374
eyes 31375
that 31376
he 31377
had 31378
found 31379
his 31380
island 31381
at 31382
last. 31383
 31384
But 31385
the 31386
holluschickie 31387
and 31388
Sea 31389
Catch, 31390
his 31391
father, 31392
and 31393
all 31394
the 31395
other 31396
seals 31397
laughed 31398
at 31399
him 31400
when 31401
he 31402
told 31403
them 31404
what 31405
he 31406
had 31407
discovered, 31408
and 31409
a 31410
young 31411
seal 31412
about 31413
his 31414
own 31415
age 31416
said, 31417
“This 31418
is 31419
all 31420
very 31421
well, 31422
Kotick, 31423
but 31424
you 31425
can’t 31426
come 31427
from 31428
no 31429
one 31430
knows 31431
where 31432
and 31433
order 31434
us 31435
off 31436
like 31437
this. 31438
Remember 31439
we’ve 31440
been 31441
fighting 31442
for 31443
our 31444
nurseries, 31445
and 31446
that’s 31447
a 31448
thing 31449
you 31450
never 31451
did. 31452
You 31453
preferred 31454
prowling 31455
about 31456
in 31457
the 31458
sea.” 31459
 31460
The 31461
other 31462
seals 31463
laughed 31464
at 31465
this, 31466
and 31467
the 31468
young 31469
seal 31470
began 31471
twisting 31472
his 31473
head 31474
from 31475
side 31476
to 31477
side. 31478
He 31479
had 31480
just 31481
married 31482
that 31483
year, 31484
and 31485
was 31486
making 31487
a 31488
great 31489
fuss 31490
about 31491
it. 31492
 31493
“I’ve 31494
no 31495
nursery 31496
to 31497
fight 31498
for,” 31499
said 31500
Kotick. 31501
“I 31502
only 31503
want 31504
to 31505
show 31506
you 31507
all 31508
a 31509
place 31510
where 31511
you 31512
will 31513
be 31514
safe. 31515
What’s 31516
the 31517
use 31518
of 31519
fighting?” 31520
 31521
“Oh, 31522
if 31523
you’re 31524
trying 31525
to 31526
back 31527
out, 31528
of 31529
course 31530
I’ve 31531
no 31532
more 31533
to 31534
say,” 31535
said 31536
the 31537
young 31538
seal 31539
with 31540
an 31541
ugly 31542
chuckle. 31543
 31544
“Will 31545
you 31546
come 31547
with 31548
me 31549
if 31550
I 31551
win?” 31552
said 31553
Kotick. 31554
And 31555
a 31556
green 31557
light 31558
came 31559
into 31560
his 31561
eye, 31562
for 31563
he 31564
was 31565
very 31566
angry 31567
at 31568
having 31569
to 31570
fight 31571
at 31572
all. 31573
 31574
“Very 31575
good,” 31576
said 31577
the 31578
young 31579
seal 31580
carelessly. 31581
“If 31582
you 31583
win, 31584
I’ll 31585
come.” 31586
 31587
He 31588
had 31589
no 31590
time 31591
to 31592
change 31593
his 31594
mind, 31595
for 31596
Kotick’s 31597
head 31598
was 31599
out 31600
and 31601
his 31602
teeth 31603
sunk 31604
in 31605
the 31606
blubber 31607
of 31608
the 31609
young 31610
seal’s 31611
neck. 31612
Then 31613
he 31614
threw 31615
himself 31616
back 31617
on 31618
his 31619
haunches 31620
and 31621
hauled 31622
his 31623
enemy 31624
down 31625
the 31626
beach, 31627
shook 31628
him, 31629
and 31630
knocked 31631
him 31632
over. 31633
Then 31634
Kotick 31635
roared 31636
to 31637
the 31638
seals: 31639
“I’ve 31640
done 31641
my 31642
best 31643
for 31644
you 31645
these 31646
five 31647
seasons 31648
past. 31649
I’ve 31650
found 31651
you 31652
the 31653
island 31654
where 31655
you’ll 31656
be 31657
safe, 31658
but 31659
unless 31660
your 31661
heads 31662
are 31663
dragged 31664
off 31665
your 31666
silly 31667
necks 31668
you 31669
won’t 31670
believe. 31671
I’m 31672
going 31673
to 31674
teach 31675
you 31676
now. 31677
Look 31678
out 31679
for 31680
yourselves!” 31681
 31682
Limmershin 31683
told 31684
me 31685
that 31686
never 31687
in 31688
his 31689
life--and 31690
Limmershin 31691
sees 31692
ten 31693
thousand 31694
big 31695
seals 31696
fighting 31697
every 31698
year--never 31699
in 31700
all 31701
his 31702
little 31703
life 31704
did 31705
he 31706
see 31707
anything 31708
like 31709
Kotick’s 31710
charge 31711
into 31712
the 31713
nurseries. 31714
He 31715
flung 31716
himself 31717
at 31718
the 31719
biggest 31720
sea 31721
catch 31722
he 31723
could 31724
find, 31725
caught 31726
him 31727
by 31728
the 31729
throat, 31730
choked 31731
him 31732
and 31733
bumped 31734
him 31735
and 31736
banged 31737
him 31738
till 31739
he 31740
grunted 31741
for 31742
mercy, 31743
and 31744
then 31745
threw 31746
him 31747
aside 31748
and 31749
attacked 31750
the 31751
next. 31752
You 31753
see, 31754
Kotick 31755
had 31756
never 31757
fasted 31758
for 31759
four 31760
months 31761
as 31762
the 31763
big 31764
seals 31765
did 31766
every 31767
year, 31768
and 31769
his 31770
deep-sea 31771
swimming 31772
trips 31773
kept 31774
him 31775
in 31776
perfect 31777
condition, 31778
and, 31779
best 31780
of 31781
all, 31782
he 31783
had 31784
never 31785
fought 31786
before. 31787
His 31788
curly 31789
white 31790
mane 31791
stood 31792
up 31793
with 31794
rage, 31795
and 31796
his 31797
eyes 31798
flamed, 31799
and 31800
his 31801
big 31802
dog 31803
teeth 31804
glistened, 31805
and 31806
he 31807
was 31808
splendid 31809
to 31810
look 31811
at. 31812
Old 31813
Sea 31814
Catch, 31815
his 31816
father, 31817
saw 31818
him 31819
tearing 31820
past, 31821
hauling 31822
the 31823
grizzled 31824
old 31825
seals 31826
about 31827
as 31828
though 31829
they 31830
had 31831
been 31832
halibut, 31833
and 31834
upsetting 31835
the 31836
young 31837
bachelors 31838
in 31839
all 31840
directions; 31841
and 31842
Sea 31843
Catch 31844
gave 31845
a 31846
roar 31847
and 31848
shouted: 31849
“He 31850
may 31851
be 31852
a 31853
fool, 31854
but 31855
he 31856
is 31857
the 31858
best 31859
fighter 31860
on 31861
the 31862
beaches! 31863
Don’t 31864
tackle 31865
your 31866
father, 31867
my 31868
son! 31869
He’s 31870
with 31871
you!” 31872
 31873
Kotick 31874
roared 31875
in 31876
answer, 31877
and 31878
old 31879
Sea 31880
Catch 31881
waddled 31882
in 31883
with 31884
his 31885
mustache 31886
on 31887
end, 31888
blowing 31889
like 31890
a 31891
locomotive, 31892
while 31893
Matkah 31894
and 31895
the 31896
seal 31897
that 31898
was 31899
going 31900
to 31901
marry 31902
Kotick 31903
cowered 31904
down 31905
and 31906
admired 31907
their 31908
men-folk. 31909
It 31910
was 31911
a 31912
gorgeous 31913
fight, 31914
for 31915
the 31916
two 31917
fought 31918
as 31919
long 31920
as 31921
there 31922
was 31923
a 31924
seal 31925
that 31926
dared 31927
lift 31928
up 31929
his 31930
head, 31931
and 31932
when 31933
there 31934
were 31935
none 31936
they 31937
paraded 31938
grandly 31939
up 31940
and 31941
down 31942
the 31943
beach 31944
side 31945
by 31946
side, 31947
bellowing. 31948
 31949
At 31950
night, 31951
just 31952
as 31953
the 31954
Northern 31955
Lights 31956
were 31957
winking 31958
and 31959
flashing 31960
through 31961
the 31962
fog, 31963
Kotick 31964
climbed 31965
a 31966
bare 31967
rock 31968
and 31969
looked 31970
down 31971
on 31972
the 31973
scattered 31974
nurseries 31975
and 31976
the 31977
torn 31978
and 31979
bleeding 31980
seals. 31981
“Now,” 31982
he 31983
said, 31984
“I’ve 31985
taught 31986
you 31987
your 31988
lesson.” 31989
 31990
“My 31991
wig!” 31992
said 31993
old 31994
Sea 31995
Catch, 31996
boosting 31997
himself 31998
up 31999
stiffly, 32000
for 32001
he 32002
was 32003
fearfully 32004
mauled. 32005
“The 32006
Killer 32007
Whale 32008
himself 32009
could 32010
not 32011
have 32012
cut 32013
them 32014
up 32015
worse. 32016
Son, 32017
I’m 32018
proud 32019
of 32020
you, 32021
and 32022
what’s 32023
more, 32024
I’ll 32025
come 32026
with 32027
you 32028
to 32029
your 32030
island--if 32031
there 32032
is 32033
such 32034
a 32035
place.” 32036
 32037
“Hear 32038
you, 32039
fat 32040
pigs 32041
of 32042
the 32043
sea. 32044
Who 32045
comes 32046
with 32047
me 32048
to 32049
the 32050
Sea 32051
Cow’s 32052
tunnel? 32053
Answer, 32054
or 32055
I 32056
shall 32057
teach 32058
you 32059
again,” 32060
roared 32061
Kotick. 32062
 32063
There 32064
was 32065
a 32066
murmur 32067
like 32068
the 32069
ripple 32070
of 32071
the 32072
tide 32073
all 32074
up 32075
and 32076
down 32077
the 32078
beaches. 32079
“We 32080
will 32081
come,” 32082
said 32083
thousands 32084
of 32085
tired 32086
voices. 32087
“We 32088
will 32089
follow 32090
Kotick, 32091
the 32092
White 32093
Seal.” 32094
 32095
Then 32096
Kotick 32097
dropped 32098
his 32099
head 32100
between 32101
his 32102
shoulders 32103
and 32104
shut 32105
his 32106
eyes 32107
proudly. 32108
He 32109
was 32110
not 32111
a 32112
white 32113
seal 32114
any 32115
more, 32116
but 32117
red 32118
from 32119
head 32120
to 32121
tail. 32122
All 32123
the 32124
same 32125
he 32126
would 32127
have 32128
scorned 32129
to 32130
look 32131
at 32132
or 32133
touch 32134
one 32135
of 32136
his 32137
wounds. 32138
 32139
A 32140
week 32141
later 32142
he 32143
and 32144
his 32145
army 32146
(nearly 32147
ten 32148
thousand 32149
holluschickie 32150
and 32151
old 32152
seals) 32153
went 32154
away 32155
north 32156
to 32157
the 32158
Sea 32159
Cow’s 32160
tunnel, 32161
Kotick 32162
leading 32163
them, 32164
and 32165
the 32166
seals 32167
that 32168
stayed 32169
at 32170
Novastoshnah 32171
called 32172
them 32173
idiots. 32174
But 32175
next 32176
spring, 32177
when 32178
they 32179
all 32180
met 32181
off 32182
the 32183
fishing 32184
banks 32185
of 32186
the 32187
Pacific, 32188
Kotick’s 32189
seals 32190
told 32191
such 32192
tales 32193
of 32194
the 32195
new 32196
beaches 32197
beyond 32198
Sea 32199
Cow’s 32200
tunnel 32201
that 32202
more 32203
and 32204
more 32205
seals 32206
left 32207
Novastoshnah. 32208
Of 32209
course 32210
it 32211
was 32212
not 32213
all 32214
done 32215
at 32216
once, 32217
for 32218
the 32219
seals 32220
are 32221
not 32222
very 32223
clever, 32224
and 32225
they 32226
need 32227
a 32228
long 32229
time 32230
to 32231
turn 32232
things 32233
over 32234
in 32235
their 32236
minds, 32237
but 32238
year 32239
after 32240
year 32241
more 32242
seals 32243
went 32244
away 32245
from 32246
Novastoshnah, 32247
and 32248
Lukannon, 32249
and 32250
the 32251
other 32252
nurseries, 32253
to 32254
the 32255
quiet, 32256
sheltered 32257
beaches 32258
where 32259
Kotick 32260
sits 32261
all 32262
the 32263
summer 32264
through, 32265
getting 32266
bigger 32267
and 32268
fatter 32269
and 32270
stronger 32271
each 32272
year, 32273
while 32274
the 32275
holluschickie 32276
play 32277
around 32278
him, 32279
in 32280
that 32281
sea 32282
where 32283
no 32284
man 32285
comes. 32286

 32288

 32290
Lukannon 32291

is 32295
the 32296
great 32297
deep-sea 32298
song 32299
that 32300
all 32301
the 32302
St. 32303
Paul 32304
seals 32305
sing 32306
when 32307
they 32308
are 32309
heading 32310
back 32311
to 32312
their 32313
beaches 32314
in 32315
the 32316
summer. 32317
It 32318
is 32319
a 32320
sort 32321
of 32322
very 32323
sad 32324
seal 32325
National 32326
Anthem. 32327
 32328
I 32329
met 32330
my 32331
mates 32332
in 32333
the 32334
morning 32335
(and, 32336
oh, 32337
but 32338
I 32339
am 32340
old!) 32341
Where 32342
roaring 32343
on 32344
the 32345
ledges 32346
the 32347
summer 32348
ground-swell 32349
rolled; 32350
I 32351
heard 32352
them 32353
lift 32354
the 32355
chorus 32356
that 32357
drowned 32358
the 32359
breakers’ 32360
song— 32361
The 32362
Beaches 32363
of 32364
Lukannon—two 32365
million 32366
voices 32367
strong. 32368

_The 32370

pleasant 32373
stations 32374
beside 32375

salt 32377
lagoons, 32378
The 32379
song 32380
of 32381
blowing 32382
squadrons 32383
that 32384
shuffled 32385
down 32386
the 32387
dunes, 32388
The 32389
song 32390
of 32391
midnight 32392
dances 32393
that 32394
churned 32395
the 32396
sea 32397
to 32398
flame— 32399

morning 32414
(I’ll 32415
never 32416
meet 32417
them 32418
more!); 32419
They 32420
came 32421
and 32422
went 32423
in 32424
legions 32425
that 32426
darkened 32427
all 32428
the 32429
shore. 32430
And 32431
o’er 32432
the 32433
foam-flecked 32434
offing 32435
as 32436
far 32437
as 32438

reach 32441
We 32442
hailed 32443
the 32444
landing-parties 32445

we 32447

them 32449

tall— 32461

shoot 32503
us 32504

This 32705
is 32706
the 32707
story 32708
of 32709
the 32710
great 32711
war 32712
that 32713
Rikki-tikki-tavi 32714
fought 32715
single-handed, 32716
through 32717
the 32718
bath-rooms 32719
of 32720
the 32721
big 32722
bungalow 32723
in 32724
Segowlee 32725
cantonment. 32726
Darzee, 32727
the 32728
Tailorbird, 32729
helped 32730
him, 32731
and 32732
Chuchundra, 32733
the 32734
muskrat, 32735
who 32736
never 32737
comes 32738
out 32739
into 32740
the 32741
middle 32742
of 32743
the 32744
floor, 32745
but 32746
always 32747
creeps 32748
round 32749
by 32750
the 32751
wall, 32752
gave 32753
him 32754
advice, 32755
but 32756
Rikki-tikki 32757
did 32758
the 32759
real 32760
fighting. 32761
 32762
He 32763
was 32764
a 32765
mongoose, 32766
rather 32767
like 32768
a 32769
little 32770
cat 32771
in 32772
his 32773
fur 32774
and 32775
his 32776
tail, 32777
but 32778
quite 32779
like 32780
a 32781
weasel 32782
in 32783
his 32784
head 32785
and 32786
his 32787
habits. 32788
His 32789
eyes 32790
and 32791
the 32792
end 32793
of 32794
his 32795
restless 32796
nose 32797
were 32798
pink. 32799
He 32800
could 32801
scratch 32802
himself 32803
anywhere 32804
he 32805
pleased 32806
with 32807
any 32808
leg, 32809
front 32810
or 32811
back, 32812
that 32813
he 32814
chose 32815
to 32816
use. 32817
He 32818
could 32819
fluff 32820
up 32821
his 32822
tail 32823
till 32824
it 32825
looked 32826
like 32827
a 32828
bottle 32829
brush, 32830
and 32831
his 32832
war 32833
cry 32834
as 32835
he 32836
scuttled 32837
through 32838
the 32839
long 32840
grass 32841
was: 32842
“Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” 32843
 32844
One 32845
day, 32846
a 32847
high 32848
summer 32849
flood 32850
washed 32851
him 32852
out 32853
of 32854
the 32855
burrow 32856
where 32857
he 32858
lived 32859
with 32860
his 32861
father 32862
and 32863
mother, 32864
and 32865
carried 32866
him, 32867
kicking 32868
and 32869
clucking, 32870
down 32871
a 32872
roadside 32873
ditch. 32874
He 32875
found 32876
a 32877
little 32878
wisp 32879
of 32880
grass 32881
floating 32882
there, 32883
and 32884
clung 32885
to 32886
it 32887
till 32888
he 32889
lost 32890
his 32891
senses. 32892
When 32893
he 32894
revived, 32895
he 32896
was 32897
lying 32898
in 32899
the 32900
hot 32901
sun 32902
on 32903
the 32904
middle 32905
of 32906
a 32907
garden 32908
path, 32909
very 32910
draggled 32911
indeed, 32912
and 32913
a 32914
small 32915
boy 32916
was 32917
saying, 32918
“Here’s 32919
a 32920
dead 32921
mongoose. 32922
Let’s 32923
have 32924
a 32925
funeral.” 32926
 32927
“No,” 32928
said 32929
his 32930
mother, 32931
“let’s 32932
take 32933
him 32934
in 32935
and 32936
dry 32937
him. 32938
Perhaps 32939
he 32940
isn’t 32941
really 32942
dead.” 32943
 32944
They 32945
took 32946
him 32947
into 32948
the 32949
house, 32950
and 32951
a 32952
big 32953
man 32954
picked 32955
him 32956
up 32957
between 32958
his 32959
finger 32960
and 32961
thumb 32962
and 32963
said 32964
he 32965
was 32966
not 32967
dead 32968
but 32969
half 32970
choked. 32971
So 32972
they 32973
wrapped 32974
him 32975
in 32976
cotton 32977
wool, 32978
and 32979
warmed 32980
him 32981
over 32982
a 32983
little 32984
fire, 32985
and 32986
he 32987
opened 32988
his 32989
eyes 32990
and 32991
sneezed. 32992
 32993
“Now,” 32994
said 32995
the 32996
big 32997
man 32998
(he 32999
was 33000
an 33001
Englishman 33002
who 33003
had 33004
just 33005
moved 33006
into 33007
the 33008
bungalow), 33009
“don’t 33010
frighten 33011
him, 33012
and 33013
we’ll 33014
see 33015
what 33016
he’ll 33017
do.” 33018
 33019
It 33020
is 33021
the 33022
hardest 33023
thing 33024
in 33025
the 33026
world 33027
to 33028
frighten 33029
a 33030
mongoose, 33031
because 33032
he 33033
is 33034
eaten 33035
up 33036
from 33037
nose 33038
to 33039
tail 33040
with 33041
curiosity. 33042
The 33043
motto 33044
of 33045
all 33046
the 33047
mongoose 33048
family 33049
is 33050
“Run 33051
and 33052
find 33053
out,” 33054
and 33055
Rikki-tikki 33056
was 33057
a 33058
true 33059
mongoose. 33060
He 33061
looked 33062
at 33063
the 33064
cotton 33065
wool, 33066
decided 33067
that 33068
it 33069
was 33070
not 33071
good 33072
to 33073
eat, 33074
ran 33075
all 33076
round 33077
the 33078
table, 33079
sat 33080
up 33081
and 33082
put 33083
his 33084
fur 33085
in 33086
order, 33087
scratched 33088
himself, 33089
and 33090
jumped 33091
on 33092
the 33093
small 33094
boy’s 33095
shoulder. 33096
 33097
“Don’t 33098
be 33099
frightened, 33100
Teddy,” 33101
said 33102
his 33103
father. 33104
“That’s 33105
his 33106
way 33107
of 33108
making 33109
friends.” 33110
 33111
“Ouch! 33112
He’s 33113
tickling 33114
under 33115
my 33116
chin,” 33117
said 33118
Teddy. 33119
 33120
Rikki-tikki 33121
looked 33122
down 33123
between 33124
the 33125
boy’s 33126
collar 33127
and 33128
neck, 33129
snuffed 33130
at 33131
his 33132
ear, 33133
and 33134
climbed 33135
down 33136
to 33137
the 33138
floor, 33139
where 33140
he 33141
sat 33142
rubbing 33143
his 33144
nose. 33145
 33146
“Good 33147
gracious,” 33148
said 33149
Teddy’s 33150
mother, 33151
“and 33152
that’s 33153
a 33154
wild 33155
creature! 33156
I 33157
suppose 33158
he’s 33159
so 33160
tame 33161
because 33162
we’ve 33163
been 33164
kind 33165
to 33166
him.” 33167
 33168
“All 33169
mongooses 33170
are 33171
like 33172
that,” 33173
said 33174
her 33175
husband. 33176
“If 33177
Teddy 33178
doesn’t 33179
pick 33180
him 33181
up 33182
by 33183
the 33184
tail, 33185
or 33186
try 33187
to 33188
put 33189
him 33190
in 33191
a 33192
cage, 33193
he’ll 33194
run 33195
in 33196
and 33197
out 33198
of 33199
the 33200
house 33201
all 33202
day 33203
long. 33204
Let’s 33205
give 33206
him 33207
something 33208
to 33209
eat.” 33210
 33211
They 33212
gave 33213
him 33214
a 33215
little 33216
piece 33217
of 33218
raw 33219
meat. 33220
Rikki-tikki 33221
liked 33222
it 33223
immensely, 33224
and 33225
when 33226
it 33227
was 33228
finished 33229
he 33230
went 33231
out 33232
into 33233
the 33234
veranda 33235
and 33236
sat 33237
in 33238
the 33239
sunshine 33240
and 33241
fluffed 33242
up 33243
his 33244
fur 33245
to 33246
make 33247
it 33248
dry 33249
to 33250
the 33251
roots. 33252
Then 33253
he 33254
felt 33255
better. 33256
 33257
“There 33258
are 33259
more 33260
things 33261
to 33262
find 33263
out 33264
about 33265
in 33266
this 33267
house,” 33268
he 33269
said 33270
to 33271
himself, 33272
“than 33273
all 33274
my 33275
family 33276
could 33277
find 33278
out 33279
in 33280
all 33281
their 33282
lives. 33283
I 33284
shall 33285
certainly 33286
stay 33287
and 33288
find 33289
out.” 33290
 33291
He 33292
spent 33293
all 33294
that 33295
day 33296
roaming 33297
over 33298
the 33299
house. 33300
He 33301
nearly 33302
drowned 33303
himself 33304
in 33305
the 33306
bath-tubs, 33307
put 33308
his 33309
nose 33310
into 33311
the 33312
ink 33313
on 33314
a 33315
writing 33316
table, 33317
and 33318
burned 33319
it 33320
on 33321
the 33322
end 33323
of 33324
the 33325
big 33326
man’s 33327
cigar, 33328
for 33329
he 33330
climbed 33331
up 33332
in 33333
the 33334
big 33335
man’s 33336
lap 33337
to 33338
see 33339
how 33340
writing 33341
was 33342
done. 33343
At 33344
nightfall 33345
he 33346
ran 33347
into 33348
Teddy’s 33349
nursery 33350
to 33351
watch 33352
how 33353
kerosene 33354
lamps 33355
were 33356
lighted, 33357
and 33358
when 33359
Teddy 33360
went 33361
to 33362
bed 33363
Rikki-tikki 33364
climbed 33365
up 33366
too. 33367
But 33368
he 33369
was 33370
a 33371
restless 33372
companion, 33373
because 33374
he 33375
had 33376
to 33377
get 33378
up 33379
and 33380
attend 33381
to 33382
every 33383
noise 33384
all 33385
through 33386
the 33387
night, 33388
and 33389
find 33390
out 33391
what 33392
made 33393
it. 33394
Teddy’s 33395
mother 33396
and 33397
father 33398
came 33399
in, 33400
the 33401
last 33402
thing, 33403
to 33404
look 33405
at 33406
their 33407
boy, 33408
and 33409
Rikki-tikki 33410
was 33411
awake 33412
on 33413
the 33414
pillow. 33415
“I 33416
don’t 33417
like 33418
that,” 33419
said 33420
Teddy’s 33421
mother. 33422
“He 33423
may 33424
bite 33425
the 33426
child.” 33427
“He’ll 33428
do 33429
no 33430
such 33431
thing,” 33432
said 33433
the 33434
father. 33435
“Teddy’s 33436
safer 33437
with 33438
that 33439
little 33440
beast 33441
than 33442
if 33443
he 33444
had 33445
a 33446
bloodhound 33447
to 33448
watch 33449
him. 33450
If 33451
a 33452
snake 33453
came 33454
into 33455
the 33456
nursery 33457
now--” 33458
 33459
But 33460
Teddy’s 33461
mother 33462
wouldn’t 33463
think 33464
of 33465
anything 33466
so 33467
awful. 33468
 33469
Early 33470
in 33471
the 33472
morning 33473
Rikki-tikki 33474
came 33475
to 33476
early 33477
breakfast 33478
in 33479
the 33480
veranda 33481
riding 33482
on 33483
Teddy’s 33484
shoulder, 33485
and 33486
they 33487
gave 33488
him 33489
banana 33490
and 33491
some 33492
boiled 33493
egg. 33494
He 33495
sat 33496
on 33497
all 33498
their 33499
laps 33500
one 33501
after 33502
the 33503
other, 33504
because 33505
every 33506
well-brought-up 33507
mongoose 33508
always 33509
hopes 33510
to 33511
be 33512
a 33513
house 33514
mongoose 33515
some 33516
day 33517
and 33518
have 33519
rooms 33520
to 33521
run 33522
about 33523
in; 33524
and 33525
Rikki-tikki’s 33526
mother 33527
(she 33528
used 33529
to 33530
live 33531
in 33532
the 33533
general’s 33534
house 33535
at 33536
Segowlee) 33537
had 33538
carefully 33539
told 33540
Rikki 33541
what 33542
to 33543
do 33544
if 33545
ever 33546
he 33547
came 33548
across 33549
white 33550
men. 33551
 33552
Then 33553
Rikki-tikki 33554
went 33555
out 33556
into 33557
the 33558
garden 33559
to 33560
see 33561
what 33562
was 33563
to 33564
be 33565
seen. 33566
It 33567
was 33568
a 33569
large 33570
garden, 33571
only 33572
half 33573
cultivated, 33574
with 33575
bushes, 33576
as 33577
big 33578
as 33579
summer-houses, 33580
of 33581
Marshal 33582
Niel 33583
roses, 33584
lime 33585
and 33586
orange 33587
trees, 33588
clumps 33589
of 33590
bamboos, 33591
and 33592
thickets 33593
of 33594
high 33595
grass. 33596
Rikki-tikki 33597
licked 33598
his 33599
lips. 33600
“This 33601
is 33602
a 33603
splendid 33604
hunting-ground,” 33605
he 33606
said, 33607
and 33608
his 33609
tail 33610
grew 33611
bottle-brushy 33612
at 33613
the 33614
thought 33615
of 33616
it, 33617
and 33618
he 33619
scuttled 33620
up 33621
and 33622
down 33623
the 33624
garden, 33625
snuffing 33626
here 33627
and 33628
there 33629
till 33630
he 33631
heard 33632
very 33633
sorrowful 33634
voices 33635
in 33636
a 33637
thorn-bush. 33638
 33639
It 33640
was 33641
Darzee, 33642
the 33643
Tailorbird, 33644
and 33645
his 33646
wife. 33647
They 33648
had 33649
made 33650
a 33651
beautiful 33652
nest 33653
by 33654
pulling 33655
two 33656
big 33657
leaves 33658
together 33659
and 33660
stitching 33661
them 33662
up 33663
the 33664
edges 33665
with 33666
fibers, 33667
and 33668
had 33669
filled 33670
the 33671
hollow 33672
with 33673
cotton 33674
and 33675
downy 33676
fluff. 33677
The 33678
nest 33679
swayed 33680
to 33681
and 33682
fro, 33683
as 33684
they 33685
sat 33686
on 33687
the 33688
rim 33689
and 33690
cried. 33691
 33692
“What 33693
is 33694
the 33695
matter?” 33696
asked 33697
Rikki-tikki. 33698
 33699
“We 33700
are 33701
very 33702
miserable,” 33703
said 33704
Darzee. 33705
“One 33706
of 33707
our 33708
babies 33709
fell 33710
out 33711
of 33712
the 33713
nest 33714
yesterday 33715
and 33716
Nag 33717
ate 33718
him.” 33719
 33720
“H’m!” 33721
said 33722
Rikki-tikki, 33723
“that 33724
is 33725
very 33726
sad--but 33727
I 33728
am 33729
a 33730
stranger 33731
here. 33732
Who 33733
is 33734
Nag?” 33735
 33736
Darzee 33737
and 33738
his 33739
wife 33740
only 33741
cowered 33742
down 33743
in 33744
the 33745
nest 33746
without 33747
answering, 33748
for 33749
from 33750
the 33751
thick 33752
grass 33753
at 33754
the 33755
foot 33756
of 33757
the 33758
bush 33759
there 33760
came 33761
a 33762
low 33763
hiss--a 33764
horrid 33765
cold 33766
sound 33767
that 33768
made 33769
Rikki-tikki 33770
jump 33771
back 33772
two 33773
clear 33774
feet. 33775
Then 33776
inch 33777
by 33778
inch 33779
out 33780
of 33781
the 33782
grass 33783
rose 33784
up 33785
the 33786
head 33787
and 33788
spread 33789
hood 33790
of 33791
Nag, 33792
the 33793
big 33794
black 33795
cobra, 33796
and 33797
he 33798
was 33799
five 33800
feet 33801
long 33802
from 33803
tongue 33804
to 33805
tail. 33806
When 33807
he 33808
had 33809
lifted 33810
one-third 33811
of 33812
himself 33813
clear 33814
of 33815
the 33816
ground, 33817
he 33818
stayed 33819
balancing 33820
to 33821
and 33822
fro 33823
exactly 33824
as 33825
a 33826
dandelion 33827
tuft 33828
balances 33829
in 33830
the 33831
wind, 33832
and 33833
he 33834
looked 33835
at 33836
Rikki-tikki 33837
with 33838
the 33839
wicked 33840
snake’s 33841
eyes 33842
that 33843
never 33844
change 33845
their 33846
expression, 33847
whatever 33848
the 33849
snake 33850
may 33851
be 33852
thinking 33853
of. 33854
 33855
“Who 33856
is 33857
Nag?” 33858
said 33859
he. 33860
“I 33861
am 33862
Nag. 33863
The 33864
great 33865
God 33866
Brahm 33867
put 33868
his 33869
mark 33870
upon 33871
all 33872
our 33873
people, 33874
when 33875
the 33876
first 33877
cobra 33878
spread 33879
his 33880
hood 33881
to 33882
keep 33883
the 33884
sun 33885
off 33886
Brahm 33887
as 33888
he 33889
slept. 33890
Look, 33891
and 33892
be 33893
afraid!” 33894
 33895
He 33896
spread 33897
out 33898
his 33899
hood 33900
more 33901
than 33902
ever, 33903
and 33904
Rikki-tikki 33905
saw 33906
the 33907
spectacle-mark 33908
on 33909
the 33910
back 33911
of 33912
it 33913
that 33914
looks 33915
exactly 33916
like 33917
the 33918
eye 33919
part 33920
of 33921
a 33922
hook-and-eye 33923
fastening. 33924
He 33925
was 33926
afraid 33927
for 33928
the 33929
minute, 33930
but 33931
it 33932
is 33933
impossible 33934
for 33935
a 33936
mongoose 33937
to 33938
stay 33939
frightened 33940
for 33941
any 33942
length 33943
of 33944
time, 33945
and 33946
though 33947
Rikki-tikki 33948
had 33949
never 33950
met 33951
a 33952
live 33953
cobra 33954
before, 33955
his 33956
mother 33957
had 33958
fed 33959
him 33960
on 33961
dead 33962
ones, 33963
and 33964
he 33965
knew 33966
that 33967
all 33968
a 33969
grown 33970
mongoose’s 33971
business 33972
in 33973
life 33974
was 33975
to 33976
fight 33977
and 33978
eat 33979
snakes. 33980
Nag 33981
knew 33982
that 33983
too 33984
and, 33985
at 33986
the 33987
bottom 33988
of 33989
his 33990
cold 33991
heart, 33992
he 33993
was 33994
afraid. 33995
 33996
“Well,” 33997
said 33998
Rikki-tikki, 33999
and 34000
his 34001
tail 34002
began 34003
to 34004
fluff 34005
up 34006
again, 34007
“marks 34008
or 34009
no 34010
marks, 34011
do 34012
you 34013
think 34014
it 34015
is 34016
right 34017
for 34018
you 34019
to 34020
eat 34021
fledglings 34022
out 34023
of 34024
a 34025
nest?” 34026
 34027
Nag 34028
was 34029
thinking 34030
to 34031
himself, 34032
and 34033
watching 34034
the 34035
least 34036
little 34037
movement 34038
in 34039
the 34040
grass 34041
behind 34042
Rikki-tikki. 34043
He 34044
knew 34045
that 34046
mongooses 34047
in 34048
the 34049
garden 34050
meant 34051
death 34052
sooner 34053
or 34054
later 34055
for 34056
him 34057
and 34058
his 34059
family, 34060
but 34061
he 34062
wanted 34063
to 34064
get 34065
Rikki-tikki 34066
off 34067
his 34068
guard. 34069
So 34070
he 34071
dropped 34072
his 34073
head 34074
a 34075
little, 34076
and 34077
put 34078
it 34079
on 34080
one 34081
side. 34082
 34083
“Let 34084
us 34085
talk,” 34086
he 34087
said. 34088
“You 34089
eat 34090
eggs. 34091
Why 34092
should 34093
not 34094
I 34095
eat 34096
birds?” 34097
 34098
“Behind 34099
you! 34100
Look 34101
behind 34102
you!” 34103
sang 34104
Darzee. 34105
 34106
Rikki-tikki 34107
knew 34108
better 34109
than 34110
to 34111
waste 34112
time 34113
in 34114
staring. 34115
He 34116
jumped 34117
up 34118
in 34119
the 34120
air 34121
as 34122
high 34123
as 34124
he 34125
could 34126
go, 34127
and 34128
just 34129
under 34130
him 34131
whizzed 34132
by 34133
the 34134
head 34135
of 34136
Nagaina, 34137
Nag’s 34138
wicked 34139
wife. 34140
She 34141
had 34142
crept 34143
up 34144
behind 34145
him 34146
as 34147
he 34148
was 34149
talking, 34150
to 34151
make 34152
an 34153
end 34154
of 34155
him. 34156
He 34157
heard 34158
her 34159
savage 34160
hiss 34161
as 34162
the 34163
stroke 34164
missed. 34165
He 34166
came 34167
down 34168
almost 34169
across 34170
her 34171
back, 34172
and 34173
if 34174
he 34175
had 34176
been 34177
an 34178
old 34179
mongoose 34180
he 34181
would 34182
have 34183
known 34184
that 34185
then 34186
was 34187
the 34188
time 34189
to 34190
break 34191
her 34192
back 34193
with 34194
one 34195
bite; 34196
but 34197
he 34198
was 34199
afraid 34200
of 34201
the 34202
terrible 34203
lashing 34204
return 34205
stroke 34206
of 34207
the 34208
cobra. 34209
He 34210
bit, 34211
indeed, 34212
but 34213
did 34214
not 34215
bite 34216
long 34217
enough, 34218
and 34219
he 34220
jumped 34221
clear 34222
of 34223
the 34224
whisking 34225
tail, 34226
leaving 34227
Nagaina 34228
torn 34229
and 34230
angry. 34231
 34232
“Wicked, 34233
wicked 34234
Darzee!” 34235
said 34236
Nag, 34237
lashing 34238
up 34239
as 34240
high 34241
as 34242
he 34243
could 34244
reach 34245
toward 34246
the 34247
nest 34248
in 34249
the 34250
thorn-bush. 34251
But 34252
Darzee 34253
had 34254
built 34255
it 34256
out 34257
of 34258
reach 34259
of 34260
snakes, 34261
and 34262
it 34263
only 34264
swayed 34265
to 34266
and 34267
fro. 34268
 34269
Rikki-tikki 34270
felt 34271
his 34272
eyes 34273
growing 34274
red 34275
and 34276
hot 34277
(when 34278
a 34279
mongoose’s 34280
eyes 34281
grow 34282
red, 34283
he 34284
is 34285
angry), 34286
and 34287
he 34288
sat 34289
back 34290
on 34291
his 34292
tail 34293
and 34294
hind 34295
legs 34296
like 34297
a 34298
little 34299
kangaroo, 34300
and 34301
looked 34302
all 34303
round 34304
him, 34305
and 34306
chattered 34307
with 34308
rage. 34309
But 34310
Nag 34311
and 34312
Nagaina 34313
had 34314
disappeared 34315
into 34316
the 34317
grass. 34318
When 34319
a 34320
snake 34321
misses 34322
its 34323
stroke, 34324
it 34325
never 34326
says 34327
anything 34328
or 34329
gives 34330
any 34331
sign 34332
of 34333
what 34334
it 34335
means 34336
to 34337
do 34338
next. 34339
Rikki-tikki 34340
did 34341
not 34342
care 34343
to 34344
follow 34345
them, 34346
for 34347
he 34348
did 34349
not 34350
feel 34351
sure 34352
that 34353
he 34354
could 34355
manage 34356
two 34357
snakes 34358
at 34359
once. 34360
So 34361
he 34362
trotted 34363
off 34364
to 34365
the 34366
gravel 34367
path 34368
near 34369
the 34370
house, 34371
and 34372
sat 34373
down 34374
to 34375
think. 34376
It 34377
was 34378
a 34379
serious 34380
matter 34381
for 34382
him. 34383
 34384
If 34385
you 34386
read 34387
the 34388
old 34389
books 34390
of 34391
natural 34392
history, 34393
you 34394
will 34395
find 34396
they 34397
say 34398
that 34399
when 34400
the 34401
mongoose 34402
fights 34403
the 34404
snake 34405
and 34406
happens 34407
to 34408
get 34409
bitten, 34410
he 34411
runs 34412
off 34413
and 34414
eats 34415
some 34416
herb 34417
that 34418
cures 34419
him. 34420
That 34421
is 34422
not 34423
true. 34424
The 34425
victory 34426
is 34427
only 34428
a 34429
matter 34430
of 34431
quickness 34432
of 34433
eye 34434
and 34435
quickness 34436
of 34437
foot--snake’s 34438
blow 34439
against 34440
mongoose’s 34441
jump--and 34442
as 34443
no 34444
eye 34445
can 34446
follow 34447
the 34448
motion 34449
of 34450
a 34451
snake’s 34452
head 34453
when 34454
it 34455
strikes, 34456
this 34457
makes 34458
things 34459
much 34460
more 34461
wonderful 34462
than 34463
any 34464
magic 34465
herb. 34466
Rikki-tikki 34467
knew 34468
he 34469
was 34470
a 34471
young 34472
mongoose, 34473
and 34474
it 34475
made 34476
him 34477
all 34478
the 34479
more 34480
pleased 34481
to 34482
think 34483
that 34484
he 34485
had 34486
managed 34487
to 34488
escape 34489
a 34490
blow 34491
from 34492
behind. 34493
It 34494
gave 34495
him 34496
confidence 34497
in 34498
himself, 34499
and 34500
when 34501
Teddy 34502
came 34503
running 34504
down 34505
the 34506
path, 34507
Rikki-tikki 34508
was 34509
ready 34510
to 34511
be 34512
petted. 34513
 34514
But 34515
just 34516
as 34517
Teddy 34518
was 34519
stooping, 34520
something 34521
wriggled 34522
a 34523
little 34524
in 34525
the 34526
dust, 34527
and 34528
a 34529
tiny 34530
voice 34531
said: 34532
“Be 34533
careful. 34534
I 34535
am 34536
Death!” 34537
It 34538
was 34539
Karait, 34540
the 34541
dusty 34542
brown 34543
snakeling 34544
that 34545
lies 34546
for 34547
choice 34548
on 34549
the 34550
dusty 34551
earth; 34552
and 34553
his 34554
bite 34555
is 34556
as 34557
dangerous 34558
as 34559
the 34560
cobra’s. 34561
But 34562
he 34563
is 34564
so 34565
small 34566
that 34567
nobody 34568
thinks 34569
of 34570
him, 34571
and 34572
so 34573
he 34574
does 34575
the 34576
more 34577
harm 34578
to 34579
people. 34580
 34581
Rikki-tikki’s 34582
eyes 34583
grew 34584
red 34585
again, 34586
and 34587
he 34588
danced 34589
up 34590
to 34591
Karait 34592
with 34593
the 34594
peculiar 34595
rocking, 34596
swaying 34597
motion 34598
that 34599
he 34600
had 34601
inherited 34602
from 34603
his 34604
family. 34605
It 34606
looks 34607
very 34608
funny, 34609
but 34610
it 34611
is 34612
so 34613
perfectly 34614
balanced 34615
a 34616
gait 34617
that 34618
you 34619
can 34620
fly 34621
off 34622
from 34623
it 34624
at 34625
any 34626
angle 34627
you 34628
please, 34629
and 34630
in 34631
dealing 34632
with 34633
snakes 34634
this 34635
is 34636
an 34637
advantage. 34638
If 34639
Rikki-tikki 34640
had 34641
only 34642
known, 34643
he 34644
was 34645
doing 34646
a 34647
much 34648
more 34649
dangerous 34650
thing 34651
than 34652
fighting 34653
Nag, 34654
for 34655
Karait 34656
is 34657
so 34658
small, 34659
and 34660
can 34661
turn 34662
so 34663
quickly, 34664
that 34665
unless 34666
Rikki 34667
bit 34668
him 34669
close 34670
to 34671
the 34672
back 34673
of 34674
the 34675
head, 34676
he 34677
would 34678
get 34679
the 34680
return 34681
stroke 34682
in 34683
his 34684
eye 34685
or 34686
his 34687
lip. 34688
But 34689
Rikki 34690
did 34691
not 34692
know. 34693
His 34694
eyes 34695
were 34696
all 34697
red, 34698
and 34699
he 34700
rocked 34701
back 34702
and 34703
forth, 34704
looking 34705
for 34706
a 34707
good 34708
place 34709
to 34710
hold. 34711
Karait 34712
struck 34713
out. 34714
Rikki 34715
jumped 34716
sideways 34717
and 34718
tried 34719
to 34720
run 34721
in, 34722
but 34723
the 34724
wicked 34725
little 34726
dusty 34727
gray 34728
head 34729
lashed 34730
within 34731
a 34732
fraction 34733
of 34734
his 34735
shoulder, 34736
and 34737
he 34738
had 34739
to 34740
jump 34741
over 34742
the 34743
body, 34744
and 34745
the 34746
head 34747
followed 34748
his 34749
heels 34750
close. 34751
 34752
Teddy 34753
shouted 34754
to 34755
the 34756
house: 34757
“Oh, 34758
look 34759
here! 34760
Our 34761
mongoose 34762
is 34763
killing 34764
a 34765
snake.” 34766
And 34767
Rikki-tikki 34768
heard 34769
a 34770
scream 34771
from 34772
Teddy’s 34773
mother. 34774
His 34775
father 34776
ran 34777
out 34778
with 34779
a 34780
stick, 34781
but 34782
by 34783
the 34784
time 34785
he 34786
came 34787
up, 34788
Karait 34789
had 34790
lunged 34791
out 34792
once 34793
too 34794
far, 34795
and 34796
Rikki-tikki 34797
had 34798
sprung, 34799
jumped 34800
on 34801
the 34802
snake’s 34803
back, 34804
dropped 34805
his 34806
head 34807
far 34808
between 34809
his 34810
forelegs, 34811
bitten 34812
as 34813
high 34814
up 34815
the 34816
back 34817
as 34818
he 34819
could 34820
get 34821
hold, 34822
and 34823
rolled 34824
away. 34825
That 34826
bite 34827
paralyzed 34828
Karait, 34829
and 34830
Rikki-tikki 34831
was 34832
just 34833
going 34834
to 34835
eat 34836
him 34837
up 34838
from 34839
the 34840
tail, 34841
after 34842
the 34843
custom 34844
of 34845
his 34846
family 34847
at 34848
dinner, 34849
when 34850
he 34851
remembered 34852
that 34853
a 34854
full 34855
meal 34856
makes 34857
a 34858
slow 34859
mongoose, 34860
and 34861
if 34862
he 34863
wanted 34864
all 34865
his 34866
strength 34867
and 34868
quickness 34869
ready, 34870
he 34871
must 34872
keep 34873
himself 34874
thin. 34875
 34876
He 34877
went 34878
away 34879
for 34880
a 34881
dust 34882
bath 34883
under 34884
the 34885
castor-oil 34886
bushes, 34887
while 34888
Teddy’s 34889
father 34890
beat 34891
the 34892
dead 34893
Karait. 34894
“What 34895
is 34896
the 34897
use 34898
of 34899
that?” 34900
thought 34901
Rikki-tikki. 34902
“I 34903
have 34904
settled 34905
it 34906
all;” 34907
and 34908
then 34909
Teddy’s 34910
mother 34911
picked 34912
him 34913
up 34914
from 34915
the 34916
dust 34917
and 34918
hugged 34919
him, 34920
crying 34921
that 34922
he 34923
had 34924
saved 34925
Teddy 34926
from 34927
death, 34928
and 34929
Teddy’s 34930
father 34931
said 34932
that 34933
he 34934
was 34935
a 34936
providence, 34937
and 34938
Teddy 34939
looked 34940
on 34941
with 34942
big 34943
scared 34944
eyes. 34945
Rikki-tikki 34946
was 34947
rather 34948
amused 34949
at 34950
all 34951
the 34952
fuss, 34953
which, 34954
of 34955
course, 34956
he 34957
did 34958
not 34959
understand. 34960
Teddy’s 34961
mother 34962
might 34963
just 34964
as 34965
well 34966
have 34967
petted 34968
Teddy 34969
for 34970
playing 34971
in 34972
the 34973
dust. 34974
Rikki 34975
was 34976
thoroughly 34977
enjoying 34978
himself. 34979
 34980
That 34981
night 34982
at 34983
dinner, 34984
walking 34985
to 34986
and 34987
fro 34988
among 34989
the 34990
wine-glasses 34991
on 34992
the 34993
table, 34994
he 34995
might 34996
have 34997
stuffed 34998
himself 34999
three 35000
times 35001
over 35002
with 35003
nice 35004
things. 35005
But 35006
he 35007
remembered 35008
Nag 35009
and 35010
Nagaina, 35011
and 35012
though 35013
it 35014
was 35015
very 35016
pleasant 35017
to 35018
be 35019
patted 35020
and 35021
petted 35022
by 35023
Teddy’s 35024
mother, 35025
and 35026
to 35027
sit 35028
on 35029
Teddy’s 35030
shoulder, 35031
his 35032
eyes 35033
would 35034
get 35035
red 35036
from 35037
time 35038
to 35039
time, 35040
and 35041
he 35042
would 35043
go 35044
off 35045
into 35046
his 35047
long 35048
war 35049
cry 35050
of 35051
“Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” 35052
 35053
Teddy 35054
carried 35055
him 35056
off 35057
to 35058
bed, 35059
and 35060
insisted 35061
on 35062
Rikki-tikki 35063
sleeping 35064
under 35065
his 35066
chin. 35067
Rikki-tikki 35068
was 35069
too 35070
well 35071
bred 35072
to 35073
bite 35074
or 35075
scratch, 35076
but 35077
as 35078
soon 35079
as 35080
Teddy 35081
was 35082
asleep 35083
he 35084
went 35085
off 35086
for 35087
his 35088
nightly 35089
walk 35090
round 35091
the 35092
house, 35093
and 35094
in 35095
the 35096
dark 35097
he 35098
ran 35099
up 35100
against 35101
Chuchundra, 35102
the 35103
muskrat, 35104
creeping 35105
around 35106
by 35107
the 35108
wall. 35109
Chuchundra 35110
is 35111
a 35112
broken-hearted 35113
little 35114
beast. 35115
He 35116
whimpers 35117
and 35118
cheeps 35119
all 35120
the 35121
night, 35122
trying 35123
to 35124
make 35125
up 35126
his 35127
mind 35128
to 35129
run 35130
into 35131
the 35132
middle 35133
of 35134
the 35135
room. 35136
But 35137
he 35138
never 35139
gets 35140
there. 35141
 35142
“Don’t 35143
kill 35144
me,” 35145
said 35146
Chuchundra, 35147
almost 35148
weeping. 35149
“Rikki-tikki, 35150
don’t 35151
kill 35152
me!” 35153
 35154
“Do 35155
you 35156
think 35157
a 35158
snake-killer 35159
kills 35160
muskrats?” 35161
said 35162
Rikki-tikki 35163
scornfully. 35164
 35165
“Those 35166
who 35167
kill 35168
snakes 35169
get 35170
killed 35171
by 35172
snakes,” 35173
said 35174
Chuchundra, 35175
more 35176
sorrowfully 35177
than 35178
ever. 35179
“And 35180
how 35181
am 35182
I 35183
to 35184
be 35185
sure 35186
that 35187
Nag 35188
won’t 35189
mistake 35190
me 35191
for 35192
you 35193
some 35194
dark 35195
night?” 35196
 35197
“There’s 35198
not 35199
the 35200
least 35201
danger,” 35202
said 35203
Rikki-tikki. 35204
“But 35205
Nag 35206
is 35207
in 35208
the 35209
garden, 35210
and 35211
I 35212
know 35213
you 35214
don’t 35215
go 35216
there.” 35217
 35218
“My 35219
cousin 35220
Chua, 35221
the 35222
rat, 35223
told 35224
me--” 35225
said 35226
Chuchundra, 35227
and 35228
then 35229
he 35230
stopped. 35231
 35232
“Told 35233
you 35234
what?” 35235
 35236
“H’sh! 35237
Nag 35238
is 35239
everywhere, 35240
Rikki-tikki. 35241
You 35242
should 35243
have 35244
talked 35245
to 35246
Chua 35247
in 35248
the 35249
garden.” 35250
 35251
“I 35252
didn’t--so 35253
you 35254
must 35255
tell 35256
me. 35257
Quick, 35258
Chuchundra, 35259
or 35260
I’ll 35261
bite 35262
you!” 35263
 35264
Chuchundra 35265
sat 35266
down 35267
and 35268
cried 35269
till 35270
the 35271
tears 35272
rolled 35273
off 35274
his 35275
whiskers. 35276
“I 35277
am 35278
a 35279
very 35280
poor 35281
man,” 35282
he 35283
sobbed. 35284
“I 35285
never 35286
had 35287
spirit 35288
enough 35289
to 35290
run 35291
out 35292
into 35293
the 35294
middle 35295
of 35296
the 35297
room. 35298
H’sh! 35299
I 35300
mustn’t 35301
tell 35302
you 35303
anything. 35304
Can’t 35305
you 35306
hear, 35307
Rikki-tikki?” 35308
 35309
Rikki-tikki 35310
listened. 35311
The 35312
house 35313
was 35314
as 35315
still 35316
as 35317
still, 35318
but 35319
he 35320
thought 35321
he 35322
could 35323
just 35324
catch 35325
the 35326
faintest 35327
scratch-scratch 35328
in 35329
the 35330
world--a 35331
noise 35332
as 35333
faint 35334
as 35335
that 35336
of 35337
a 35338
wasp 35339
walking 35340
on 35341
a 35342
window-pane--the 35343
dry 35344
scratch 35345
of 35346
a 35347
snake’s 35348
scales 35349
on 35350
brick-work. 35351
 35352
“That’s 35353
Nag 35354
or 35355
Nagaina,” 35356
he 35357
said 35358
to 35359
himself, 35360
“and 35361
he 35362
is 35363
crawling 35364
into 35365
the 35366
bath-room 35367
sluice. 35368
You’re 35369
right, 35370
Chuchundra; 35371
I 35372
should 35373
have 35374
talked 35375
to 35376
Chua.” 35377
 35378
He 35379
stole 35380
off 35381
to 35382
Teddy’s 35383
bath-room, 35384
but 35385
there 35386
was 35387
nothing 35388
there, 35389
and 35390
then 35391
to 35392
Teddy’s 35393
mother’s 35394
bathroom. 35395
At 35396
the 35397
bottom 35398
of 35399
the 35400
smooth 35401
plaster 35402
wall 35403
there 35404
was 35405
a 35406
brick 35407
pulled 35408
out 35409
to 35410
make 35411
a 35412
sluice 35413
for 35414
the 35415
bath 35416
water, 35417
and 35418
as 35419
Rikki-tikki 35420
stole 35421
in 35422
by 35423
the 35424
masonry 35425
curb 35426
where 35427
the 35428
bath 35429
is 35430
put, 35431
he 35432
heard 35433
Nag 35434
and 35435
Nagaina 35436
whispering 35437
together 35438
outside 35439
in 35440
the 35441
moonlight. 35442
 35443
“When 35444
the 35445
house 35446
is 35447
emptied 35448
of 35449
people,” 35450
said 35451
Nagaina 35452
to 35453
her 35454
husband, 35455
“he 35456
will 35457
have 35458
to 35459
go 35460
away, 35461
and 35462
then 35463
the 35464
garden 35465
will 35466
be 35467
our 35468
own 35469
again. 35470
Go 35471
in 35472
quietly, 35473
and 35474
remember 35475
that 35476
the 35477
big 35478
man 35479
who 35480
killed 35481
Karait 35482
is 35483
the 35484
first 35485
one 35486
to 35487
bite. 35488
Then 35489
come 35490
out 35491
and 35492
tell 35493
me, 35494
and 35495
we 35496
will 35497
hunt 35498
for 35499
Rikki-tikki 35500
together.” 35501
 35502
“But 35503
are 35504
you 35505
sure 35506
that 35507
there 35508
is 35509
anything 35510
to 35511
be 35512
gained 35513
by 35514
killing 35515
the 35516
people?” 35517
said 35518
Nag. 35519
 35520
“Everything. 35521
When 35522
there 35523
were 35524
no 35525
people 35526
in 35527
the 35528
bungalow, 35529
did 35530
we 35531
have 35532
any 35533
mongoose 35534
in 35535
the 35536
garden? 35537
So 35538
long 35539
as 35540
the 35541
bungalow 35542
is 35543
empty, 35544
we 35545
are 35546
king 35547
and 35548
queen 35549
of 35550
the 35551
garden; 35552
and 35553
remember 35554
that 35555
as 35556
soon 35557
as 35558
our 35559
eggs 35560
in 35561
the 35562
melon 35563
bed 35564
hatch 35565
(as 35566
they 35567
may 35568
tomorrow), 35569
our 35570
children 35571
will 35572
need 35573
room 35574
and 35575
quiet.” 35576
 35577
“I 35578
had 35579
not 35580
thought 35581
of 35582
that,” 35583
said 35584
Nag. 35585
“I 35586
will 35587
go, 35588
but 35589
there 35590
is 35591
no 35592
need 35593
that 35594
we 35595
should 35596
hunt 35597
for 35598
Rikki-tikki 35599
afterward. 35600
I 35601
will 35602
kill 35603
the 35604
big 35605
man 35606
and 35607
his 35608
wife, 35609
and 35610
the 35611
child 35612
if 35613
I 35614
can, 35615
and 35616
come 35617
away 35618
quietly. 35619
Then 35620
the 35621
bungalow 35622
will 35623
be 35624
empty, 35625
and 35626
Rikki-tikki 35627
will 35628
go.” 35629
 35630
Rikki-tikki 35631
tingled 35632
all 35633
over 35634
with 35635
rage 35636
and 35637
hatred 35638
at 35639
this, 35640
and 35641
then 35642
Nag’s 35643
head 35644
came 35645
through 35646
the 35647
sluice, 35648
and 35649
his 35650
five 35651
feet 35652
of 35653
cold 35654
body 35655
followed 35656
it. 35657
Angry 35658
as 35659
he 35660
was, 35661
Rikki-tikki 35662
was 35663
very 35664
frightened 35665
as 35666
he 35667
saw 35668
the 35669
size 35670
of 35671
the 35672
big 35673
cobra. 35674
Nag 35675
coiled 35676
himself 35677
up, 35678
raised 35679
his 35680
head, 35681
and 35682
looked 35683
into 35684
the 35685
bathroom 35686
in 35687
the 35688
dark, 35689
and 35690
Rikki 35691
could 35692
see 35693
his 35694
eyes 35695
glitter. 35696
 35697
“Now, 35698
if 35699
I 35700
kill 35701
him 35702
here, 35703
Nagaina 35704
will 35705
know; 35706
and 35707
if 35708
I 35709
fight 35710
him 35711
on 35712
the 35713
open 35714
floor, 35715
the 35716
odds 35717
are 35718
in 35719
his 35720
favor. 35721
What 35722
am 35723
I 35724
to 35725
do?” 35726
said 35727
Rikki-tikki-tavi. 35728
 35729
Nag 35730
waved 35731
to 35732
and 35733
fro, 35734
and 35735
then 35736
Rikki-tikki 35737
heard 35738
him 35739
drinking 35740
from 35741
the 35742
biggest 35743
water-jar 35744
that 35745
was 35746
used 35747
to 35748
fill 35749
the 35750
bath. 35751
“That 35752
is 35753
good,” 35754
said 35755
the 35756
snake. 35757
“Now, 35758
when 35759
Karait 35760
was 35761
killed, 35762
the 35763
big 35764
man 35765
had 35766
a 35767
stick. 35768
He 35769
may 35770
have 35771
that 35772
stick 35773
still, 35774
but 35775
when 35776
he 35777
comes 35778
in 35779
to 35780
bathe 35781
in 35782
the 35783
morning 35784
he 35785
will 35786
not 35787
have 35788
a 35789
stick. 35790
I 35791
shall 35792
wait 35793
here 35794
till 35795
he 35796
comes. 35797
Nagaina--do 35798
you 35799
hear 35800
me?--I 35801
shall 35802
wait 35803
here 35804
in 35805
the 35806
cool 35807
till 35808
daytime.” 35809
 35810
There 35811
was 35812
no 35813
answer 35814
from 35815
outside, 35816
so 35817
Rikki-tikki 35818
knew 35819
Nagaina 35820
had 35821
gone 35822
away. 35823
Nag 35824
coiled 35825
himself 35826
down, 35827
coil 35828
by 35829
coil, 35830
round 35831
the 35832
bulge 35833
at 35834
the 35835
bottom 35836
of 35837
the 35838
water 35839
jar, 35840
and 35841
Rikki-tikki 35842
stayed 35843
still 35844
as 35845
death. 35846
After 35847
an 35848
hour 35849
he 35850
began 35851
to 35852
move, 35853
muscle 35854
by 35855
muscle, 35856
toward 35857
the 35858
jar. 35859
Nag 35860
was 35861
asleep, 35862
and 35863
Rikki-tikki 35864
looked 35865
at 35866
his 35867
big 35868
back, 35869
wondering 35870
which 35871
would 35872
be 35873
the 35874
best 35875
place 35876
for 35877
a 35878
good 35879
hold. 35880
“If 35881
I 35882
don’t 35883
break 35884
his 35885
back 35886
at 35887
the 35888
first 35889
jump,” 35890
said 35891
Rikki, 35892
“he 35893
can 35894
still 35895
fight. 35896
And 35897
if 35898
he 35899
fights--O 35900
Rikki!” 35901
He 35902
looked 35903
at 35904
the 35905
thickness 35906
of 35907
the 35908
neck 35909
below 35910
the 35911
hood, 35912
but 35913
that 35914
was 35915
too 35916
much 35917
for 35918
him; 35919
and 35920
a 35921
bite 35922
near 35923
the 35924
tail 35925
would 35926
only 35927
make 35928
Nag 35929
savage. 35930
 35931
“It 35932
must 35933
be 35934
the 35935
head”’ 35936
he 35937
said 35938
at 35939
last; 35940
“the 35941
head 35942
above 35943
the 35944
hood. 35945
And, 35946
when 35947
I 35948
am 35949
once 35950
there, 35951
I 35952
must 35953
not 35954
let 35955
go.” 35956
 35957
Then 35958
he 35959
jumped. 35960
The 35961
head 35962
was 35963
lying 35964
a 35965
little 35966
clear 35967
of 35968
the 35969
water 35970
jar, 35971
under 35972
the 35973
curve 35974
of 35975
it; 35976
and, 35977
as 35978
his 35979
teeth 35980
met, 35981
Rikki 35982
braced 35983
his 35984
back 35985
against 35986
the 35987
bulge 35988
of 35989
the 35990
red 35991
earthenware 35992
to 35993
hold 35994
down 35995
the 35996
head. 35997
This 35998
gave 35999
him 36000
just 36001
one 36002
second’s 36003
purchase, 36004
and 36005
he 36006
made 36007
the 36008
most 36009
of 36010
it. 36011
Then 36012
he 36013
was 36014
battered 36015
to 36016
and 36017
fro 36018
as 36019
a 36020
rat 36021
is 36022
shaken 36023
by 36024
a 36025
dog--to 36026
and 36027
fro 36028
on 36029
the 36030
floor, 36031
up 36032
and 36033
down, 36034
and 36035
around 36036
in 36037
great 36038
circles, 36039
but 36040
his 36041
eyes 36042
were 36043
red 36044
and 36045
he 36046
held 36047
on 36048
as 36049
the 36050
body 36051
cart-whipped 36052
over 36053
the 36054
floor, 36055
upsetting 36056
the 36057
tin 36058
dipper 36059
and 36060
the 36061
soap 36062
dish 36063
and 36064
the 36065
flesh 36066
brush, 36067
and 36068
banged 36069
against 36070
the 36071
tin 36072
side 36073
of 36074
the 36075
bath. 36076
As 36077
he 36078
held 36079
he 36080
closed 36081
his 36082
jaws 36083
tighter 36084
and 36085
tighter, 36086
for 36087
he 36088
made 36089
sure 36090
he 36091
would 36092
be 36093
banged 36094
to 36095
death, 36096
and, 36097
for 36098
the 36099
honor 36100
of 36101
his 36102
family, 36103
he 36104
preferred 36105
to 36106
be 36107
found 36108
with 36109
his 36110
teeth 36111
locked. 36112
He 36113
was 36114
dizzy, 36115
aching, 36116
and 36117
felt 36118
shaken 36119
to 36120
pieces 36121
when 36122
something 36123
went 36124
off 36125
like 36126
a 36127
thunderclap 36128
just 36129
behind 36130
him. 36131
A 36132
hot 36133
wind 36134
knocked 36135
him 36136
senseless 36137
and 36138
red 36139
fire 36140
singed 36141
his 36142
fur. 36143
The 36144
big 36145
man 36146
had 36147
been 36148
wakened 36149
by 36150
the 36151
noise, 36152
and 36153
had 36154
fired 36155
both 36156
barrels 36157
of 36158
a 36159
shotgun 36160
into 36161
Nag 36162
just 36163
behind 36164
the 36165
hood. 36166
 36167
Rikki-tikki 36168
held 36169
on 36170
with 36171
his 36172
eyes 36173
shut, 36174
for 36175
now 36176
he 36177
was 36178
quite 36179
sure 36180
he 36181
was 36182
dead. 36183
But 36184
the 36185
head 36186
did 36187
not 36188
move, 36189
and 36190
the 36191
big 36192
man 36193
picked 36194
him 36195
up 36196
and 36197
said, 36198
“It’s 36199
the 36200
mongoose 36201
again, 36202
Alice. 36203
The 36204
little 36205
chap 36206
has 36207
saved 36208
our 36209
lives 36210
now.” 36211
 36212
Then 36213
Teddy’s 36214
mother 36215
came 36216
in 36217
with 36218
a 36219
very 36220
white 36221
face, 36222
and 36223
saw 36224
what 36225
was 36226
left 36227
of 36228
Nag, 36229
and 36230
Rikki-tikki 36231
dragged 36232
himself 36233
to 36234
Teddy’s 36235
bedroom 36236
and 36237
spent 36238
half 36239
the 36240
rest 36241
of 36242
the 36243
night 36244
shaking 36245
himself 36246
tenderly 36247
to 36248
find 36249
out 36250
whether 36251
he 36252
really 36253
was 36254
broken 36255
into 36256
forty 36257
pieces, 36258
as 36259
he 36260
fancied. 36261
 36262
When 36263
morning 36264
came 36265
he 36266
was 36267
very 36268
stiff, 36269
but 36270
well 36271
pleased 36272
with 36273
his 36274
doings. 36275
“Now 36276
I 36277
have 36278
Nagaina 36279
to 36280
settle 36281
with, 36282
and 36283
she 36284
will 36285
be 36286
worse 36287
than 36288
five 36289
Nags, 36290
and 36291
there’s 36292
no 36293
knowing 36294
when 36295
the 36296
eggs 36297
she 36298
spoke 36299
of 36300
will 36301
hatch. 36302
Goodness! 36303
I 36304
must 36305
go 36306
and 36307
see 36308
Darzee,” 36309
he 36310
said. 36311
 36312
Without 36313
waiting 36314
for 36315
breakfast, 36316
Rikki-tikki 36317
ran 36318
to 36319
the 36320
thornbush 36321
where 36322
Darzee 36323
was 36324
singing 36325
a 36326
song 36327
of 36328
triumph 36329
at 36330
the 36331
top 36332
of 36333
his 36334
voice. 36335
The 36336
news 36337
of 36338
Nag’s 36339
death 36340
was 36341
all 36342
over 36343
the 36344
garden, 36345
for 36346
the 36347
sweeper 36348
had 36349
thrown 36350
the 36351
body 36352
on 36353
the 36354
rubbish-heap. 36355
 36356
“Oh, 36357
you 36358
stupid 36359
tuft 36360
of 36361
feathers!” 36362
said 36363
Rikki-tikki 36364
angrily. 36365
“Is 36366
this 36367
the 36368
time 36369
to 36370
sing?” 36371
 36372
“Nag 36373
is 36374
dead--is 36375
dead--is 36376
dead!” 36377
sang 36378
Darzee. 36379
“The 36380
valiant 36381
Rikki-tikki 36382
caught 36383
him 36384
by 36385
the 36386
head 36387
and 36388
held 36389
fast. 36390
The 36391
big 36392
man 36393
brought 36394
the 36395
bang-stick, 36396
and 36397
Nag 36398
fell 36399
in 36400
two 36401
pieces! 36402
He 36403
will 36404
never 36405
eat 36406
my 36407
babies 36408
again.” 36409
 36410
“All 36411
that’s 36412
true 36413
enough. 36414
But 36415
where’s 36416
Nagaina?” 36417
said 36418
Rikki-tikki, 36419
looking 36420
carefully 36421
round 36422
him. 36423
 36424
“Nagaina 36425
came 36426
to 36427
the 36428
bathroom 36429
sluice 36430
and 36431
called 36432
for 36433
Nag,” 36434
Darzee 36435
went 36436
on, 36437
“and 36438
Nag 36439
came 36440
out 36441
on 36442
the 36443
end 36444
of 36445
a 36446
stick--the 36447
sweeper 36448
picked 36449
him 36450
up 36451
on 36452
the 36453
end 36454
of 36455
a 36456
stick 36457
and 36458
threw 36459
him 36460
upon 36461
the 36462
rubbish 36463
heap. 36464
Let 36465
us 36466
sing 36467
about 36468
the 36469
great, 36470
the 36471
red-eyed 36472
Rikki-tikki!” 36473
And 36474
Darzee 36475
filled 36476
his 36477
throat 36478
and 36479
sang. 36480
 36481
“If 36482
I 36483
could 36484
get 36485
up 36486
to 36487
your 36488
nest, 36489
I’d 36490
roll 36491
your 36492
babies 36493
out!” 36494
said 36495
Rikki-tikki. 36496
“You 36497
don’t 36498
know 36499
when 36500
to 36501
do 36502
the 36503
right 36504
thing 36505
at 36506
the 36507
right 36508
time. 36509
You’re 36510
safe 36511
enough 36512
in 36513
your 36514
nest 36515
there, 36516
but 36517
it’s 36518
war 36519
for 36520
me 36521
down 36522
here. 36523
Stop 36524
singing 36525
a 36526
minute, 36527
Darzee.” 36528
 36529
“For 36530
the 36531
great, 36532
the 36533
beautiful 36534
Rikki-tikki’s 36535
sake 36536
I 36537
will 36538
stop,” 36539
said 36540
Darzee. 36541
“What 36542
is 36543
it, 36544
O 36545
Killer 36546
of 36547
the 36548
terrible 36549
Nag?” 36550
 36551
“Where 36552
is 36553
Nagaina, 36554
for 36555
the 36556
third 36557
time?” 36558
 36559
“On 36560
the 36561
rubbish 36562
heap 36563
by 36564
the 36565
stables, 36566
mourning 36567
for 36568
Nag. 36569
Great 36570
is 36571
Rikki-tikki 36572
with 36573
the 36574
white 36575
teeth.” 36576
 36577
“Bother 36578
my 36579
white 36580
teeth! 36581
Have 36582
you 36583
ever 36584
heard 36585
where 36586
she 36587
keeps 36588
her 36589
eggs?” 36590
 36591
“In 36592
the 36593
melon 36594
bed, 36595
on 36596
the 36597
end 36598
nearest 36599
the 36600
wall, 36601
where 36602
the 36603
sun 36604
strikes 36605
nearly 36606
all 36607
day. 36608
She 36609
hid 36610
them 36611
there 36612
weeks 36613
ago.” 36614
 36615
“And 36616
you 36617
never 36618
thought 36619
it 36620
worth 36621
while 36622
to 36623
tell 36624
me? 36625
The 36626
end 36627
nearest 36628
the 36629
wall, 36630
you 36631
said?” 36632
 36633
“Rikki-tikki, 36634
you 36635
are 36636
not 36637
going 36638
to 36639
eat 36640
her 36641
eggs?” 36642
 36643
“Not 36644
eat 36645
exactly; 36646
no. 36647
Darzee, 36648
if 36649
you 36650
have 36651
a 36652
grain 36653
of 36654
sense 36655
you 36656
will 36657
fly 36658
off 36659
to 36660
the 36661
stables 36662
and 36663
pretend 36664
that 36665
your 36666
wing 36667
is 36668
broken, 36669
and 36670
let 36671
Nagaina 36672
chase 36673
you 36674
away 36675
to 36676
this 36677
bush. 36678
I 36679
must 36680
get 36681
to 36682
the 36683
melon-bed, 36684
and 36685
if 36686
I 36687
went 36688
there 36689
now 36690
she’d 36691
see 36692
me.” 36693
 36694
Darzee 36695
was 36696
a 36697
feather-brained 36698
little 36699
fellow 36700
who 36701
could 36702
never 36703
hold 36704
more 36705
than 36706
one 36707
idea 36708
at 36709
a 36710
time 36711
in 36712
his 36713
head. 36714
And 36715
just 36716
because 36717
he 36718
knew 36719
that 36720
Nagaina’s 36721
children 36722
were 36723
born 36724
in 36725
eggs 36726
like 36727
his 36728
own, 36729
he 36730
didn’t 36731
think 36732
at 36733
first 36734
that 36735
it 36736
was 36737
fair 36738
to 36739
kill 36740
them. 36741
But 36742
his 36743
wife 36744
was 36745
a 36746
sensible 36747
bird, 36748
and 36749
she 36750
knew 36751
that 36752
cobra’s 36753
eggs 36754
meant 36755
young 36756
cobras 36757
later 36758
on. 36759
So 36760
she 36761
flew 36762
off 36763
from 36764
the 36765
nest, 36766
and 36767
left 36768
Darzee 36769
to 36770
keep 36771
the 36772
babies 36773
warm, 36774
and 36775
continue 36776
his 36777
song 36778
about 36779
the 36780
death 36781
of 36782
Nag. 36783
Darzee 36784
was 36785
very 36786
like 36787
a 36788
man 36789
in 36790
some 36791
ways. 36792
 36793
She 36794
fluttered 36795
in 36796
front 36797
of 36798
Nagaina 36799
by 36800
the 36801
rubbish 36802
heap 36803
and 36804
cried 36805
out, 36806
“Oh, 36807
my 36808
wing 36809
is 36810
broken! 36811
The 36812
boy 36813
in 36814
the 36815
house 36816
threw 36817
a 36818
stone 36819
at 36820
me 36821
and 36822
broke 36823
it.” 36824
Then 36825
she 36826
fluttered 36827
more 36828
desperately 36829
than 36830
ever. 36831
 36832
Nagaina 36833
lifted 36834
up 36835
her 36836
head 36837
and 36838
hissed, 36839
“You 36840
warned 36841
Rikki-tikki 36842
when 36843
I 36844
would 36845
have 36846
killed 36847
him. 36848
Indeed 36849
and 36850
truly, 36851
you’ve 36852
chosen 36853
a 36854
bad 36855
place 36856
to 36857
be 36858
lame 36859
in.” 36860
And 36861
she 36862
moved 36863
toward 36864
Darzee’s 36865
wife, 36866
slipping 36867
along 36868
over 36869
the 36870
dust. 36871
 36872
“The 36873
boy 36874
broke 36875
it 36876
with 36877
a 36878
stone!” 36879
shrieked 36880
Darzee’s 36881
wife. 36882
 36883
“Well! 36884
It 36885
may 36886
be 36887
some 36888
consolation 36889
to 36890
you 36891
when 36892
you’re 36893
dead 36894
to 36895
know 36896
that 36897
I 36898
shall 36899
settle 36900
accounts 36901
with 36902
the 36903
boy. 36904
My 36905
husband 36906
lies 36907
on 36908
the 36909
rubbish 36910
heap 36911
this 36912
morning, 36913
but 36914
before 36915
night 36916
the 36917
boy 36918
in 36919
the 36920
house 36921
will 36922
lie 36923
very 36924
still. 36925
What 36926
is 36927
the 36928
use 36929
of 36930
running 36931
away? 36932
I 36933
am 36934
sure 36935
to 36936
catch 36937
you. 36938
Little 36939
fool, 36940
look 36941
at 36942
me!” 36943
 36944
Darzee’s 36945
wife 36946
knew 36947
better 36948
than 36949
to 36950
do 36951
that, 36952
for 36953
a 36954
bird 36955
who 36956
looks 36957
at 36958
a 36959
snake’s 36960
eyes 36961
gets 36962
so 36963
frightened 36964
that 36965
she 36966
cannot 36967
move. 36968
Darzee’s 36969
wife 36970
fluttered 36971
on, 36972
piping 36973
sorrowfully, 36974
and 36975
never 36976
leaving 36977
the 36978
ground, 36979
and 36980
Nagaina 36981
quickened 36982
her 36983
pace. 36984
 36985
Rikki-tikki 36986
heard 36987
them 36988
going 36989
up 36990
the 36991
path 36992
from 36993
the 36994
stables, 36995
and 36996
he 36997
raced 36998
for 36999
the 37000
end 37001
of 37002
the 37003
melon 37004
patch 37005
near 37006
the 37007
wall. 37008
There, 37009
in 37010
the 37011
warm 37012
litter 37013
above 37014
the 37015
melons, 37016
very 37017
cunningly 37018
hidden, 37019
he 37020
found 37021
twenty-five 37022
eggs, 37023
about 37024
the 37025
size 37026
of 37027
a 37028
bantam’s 37029
eggs, 37030
but 37031
with 37032
whitish 37033
skin 37034
instead 37035
of 37036
shell. 37037
 37038
“I 37039
was 37040
not 37041
a 37042
day 37043
too 37044
soon,” 37045
he 37046
said, 37047
for 37048
he 37049
could 37050
see 37051
the 37052
baby 37053
cobras 37054
curled 37055
up 37056
inside 37057
the 37058
skin, 37059
and 37060
he 37061
knew 37062
that 37063
the 37064
minute 37065
they 37066
were 37067
hatched 37068
they 37069
could 37070
each 37071
kill 37072
a 37073
man 37074
or 37075
a 37076
mongoose. 37077
He 37078
bit 37079
off 37080
the 37081
tops 37082
of 37083
the 37084
eggs 37085
as 37086
fast 37087
as 37088
he 37089
could, 37090
taking 37091
care 37092
to 37093
crush 37094
the 37095
young 37096
cobras, 37097
and 37098
turned 37099
over 37100
the 37101
litter 37102
from 37103
time 37104
to 37105
time 37106
to 37107
see 37108
whether 37109
he 37110
had 37111
missed 37112
any. 37113
At 37114
last 37115
there 37116
were 37117
only 37118
three 37119
eggs 37120
left, 37121
and 37122
Rikki-tikki 37123
began 37124
to 37125
chuckle 37126
to 37127
himself, 37128
when 37129
he 37130
heard 37131
Darzee’s 37132
wife 37133
screaming: 37134
 37135
“Rikki-tikki, 37136
I 37137
led 37138
Nagaina 37139
toward 37140
the 37141
house, 37142
and 37143
she 37144
has 37145
gone 37146
into 37147
the 37148
veranda, 37149
and--oh, 37150
come 37151
quickly--she 37152
means 37153
killing!” 37154
 37155
Rikki-tikki 37156
smashed 37157
two 37158
eggs, 37159
and 37160
tumbled 37161
backward 37162
down 37163
the 37164
melon-bed 37165
with 37166
the 37167
third 37168
egg 37169
in 37170
his 37171
mouth, 37172
and 37173
scuttled 37174
to 37175
the 37176
veranda 37177
as 37178
hard 37179
as 37180
he 37181
could 37182
put 37183
foot 37184
to 37185
the 37186
ground. 37187
Teddy 37188
and 37189
his 37190
mother 37191
and 37192
father 37193
were 37194
there 37195
at 37196
early 37197
breakfast, 37198
but 37199
Rikki-tikki 37200
saw 37201
that 37202
they 37203
were 37204
not 37205
eating 37206
anything. 37207
They 37208
sat 37209
stone-still, 37210
and 37211
their 37212
faces 37213
were 37214
white. 37215
Nagaina 37216
was 37217
coiled 37218
up 37219
on 37220
the 37221
matting 37222
by 37223
Teddy’s 37224
chair, 37225
within 37226
easy 37227
striking 37228
distance 37229
of 37230
Teddy’s 37231
bare 37232
leg, 37233
and 37234
she 37235
was 37236
swaying 37237
to 37238
and 37239
fro, 37240
singing 37241
a 37242
song 37243
of 37244
triumph. 37245
 37246
“Son 37247
of 37248
the 37249
big 37250
man 37251
that 37252
killed 37253
Nag,” 37254
she 37255
hissed, 37256
“stay 37257
still. 37258
I 37259
am 37260
not 37261
ready 37262
yet. 37263
Wait 37264
a 37265
little. 37266
Keep 37267
very 37268
still, 37269
all 37270
you 37271
three! 37272
If 37273
you 37274
move 37275
I 37276
strike, 37277
and 37278
if 37279
you 37280
do 37281
not 37282
move 37283
I 37284
strike. 37285
Oh, 37286
foolish 37287
people, 37288
who 37289
killed 37290
my 37291
Nag!” 37292
 37293
Teddy’s 37294
eyes 37295
were 37296
fixed 37297
on 37298
his 37299
father, 37300
and 37301
all 37302
his 37303
father 37304
could 37305
do 37306
was 37307
to 37308
whisper, 37309
“Sit 37310
still, 37311
Teddy. 37312
You 37313
mustn’t 37314
move. 37315
Teddy, 37316
keep 37317
still.” 37318
 37319
Then 37320
Rikki-tikki 37321
came 37322
up 37323
and 37324
cried, 37325
“Turn 37326
round, 37327
Nagaina. 37328
Turn 37329
and 37330
fight!” 37331
 37332
“All 37333
in 37334
good 37335
time,” 37336
said 37337
she, 37338
without 37339
moving 37340
her 37341
eyes. 37342
“I 37343
will 37344
settle 37345
my 37346
account 37347
with 37348
you 37349
presently. 37350
Look 37351
at 37352
your 37353
friends, 37354
Rikki-tikki. 37355
They 37356
are 37357
still 37358
and 37359
white. 37360
They 37361
are 37362
afraid. 37363
They 37364
dare 37365
not 37366
move, 37367
and 37368
if 37369
you 37370
come 37371
a 37372
step 37373
nearer 37374
I 37375
strike.” 37376
 37377
“Look 37378
at 37379
your 37380
eggs,” 37381
said 37382
Rikki-tikki, 37383
“in 37384
the 37385
melon 37386
bed 37387
near 37388
the 37389
wall. 37390
Go 37391
and 37392
look, 37393
Nagaina!” 37394
 37395
The 37396
big 37397
snake 37398
turned 37399
half 37400
around, 37401
and 37402
saw 37403
the 37404
egg 37405
on 37406
the 37407
veranda. 37408
“Ah-h! 37409
Give 37410
it 37411
to 37412
me,” 37413
she 37414
said. 37415
 37416
Rikki-tikki 37417
put 37418
his 37419
paws 37420
one 37421
on 37422
each 37423
side 37424
of 37425
the 37426
egg, 37427
and 37428
his 37429
eyes 37430
were 37431
blood-red. 37432
“What 37433
price 37434
for 37435
a 37436
snake’s 37437
egg? 37438
For 37439
a 37440
young 37441
cobra? 37442
For 37443
a 37444
young 37445
king 37446
cobra? 37447
For 37448
the 37449
last--the 37450
very 37451
last 37452
of 37453
the 37454
brood? 37455
The 37456
ants 37457
are 37458
eating 37459
all 37460
the 37461
others 37462
down 37463
by 37464
the 37465
melon 37466
bed.” 37467
 37468
Nagaina 37469
spun 37470
clear 37471
round, 37472
forgetting 37473
everything 37474
for 37475
the 37476
sake 37477
of 37478
the 37479
one 37480
egg. 37481
Rikki-tikki 37482
saw 37483
Teddy’s 37484
father 37485
shoot 37486
out 37487
a 37488
big 37489
hand, 37490
catch 37491
Teddy 37492
by 37493
the 37494
shoulder, 37495
and 37496
drag 37497
him 37498
across 37499
the 37500
little 37501
table 37502
with 37503
the 37504
tea-cups, 37505
safe 37506
and 37507
out 37508
of 37509
reach 37510
of 37511
Nagaina. 37512
 37513
“Tricked! 37514
Tricked! 37515
Tricked! 37516
Rikk-tck-tck!” 37517
chuckled 37518
Rikki-tikki. 37519
“The 37520
boy 37521
is 37522
safe, 37523
and 37524
it 37525
was 37526
I--I--I 37527
that 37528
caught 37529
Nag 37530
by 37531
the 37532
hood 37533
last 37534
night 37535
in 37536
the 37537
bathroom.” 37538
Then 37539
he 37540
began 37541
to 37542
jump 37543
up 37544
and 37545
down, 37546
all 37547
four 37548
feet 37549
together, 37550
his 37551
head 37552
close 37553
to 37554
the 37555
floor. 37556
“He 37557
threw 37558
me 37559
to 37560
and 37561
fro, 37562
but 37563
he 37564
could 37565
not 37566
shake 37567
me 37568
off. 37569
He 37570
was 37571
dead 37572
before 37573
the 37574
big 37575
man 37576
blew 37577
him 37578
in 37579
two. 37580
I 37581
did 37582
it! 37583
Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! 37584
Come 37585
then, 37586
Nagaina. 37587
Come 37588
and 37589
fight 37590
with 37591
me. 37592
You 37593
shall 37594
not 37595
be 37596
a 37597
widow 37598
long.” 37599
 37600
Nagaina 37601
saw 37602
that 37603
she 37604
had 37605
lost 37606
her 37607
chance 37608
of 37609
killing 37610
Teddy, 37611
and 37612
the 37613
egg 37614
lay 37615
between 37616
Rikki-tikki’s 37617
paws. 37618
“Give 37619
me 37620
the 37621
egg, 37622
Rikki-tikki. 37623
Give 37624
me 37625
the 37626
last 37627
of 37628
my 37629
eggs, 37630
and 37631
I 37632
will 37633
go 37634
away 37635
and 37636
never 37637
come 37638
back,” 37639
she 37640
said, 37641
lowering 37642
her 37643
hood. 37644
 37645
“Yes, 37646
you 37647
will 37648
go 37649
away, 37650
and 37651
you 37652
will 37653
never 37654
come 37655
back. 37656
For 37657
you 37658
will 37659
go 37660
to 37661
the 37662
rubbish 37663
heap 37664
with 37665
Nag. 37666
Fight, 37667
widow! 37668
The 37669
big 37670
man 37671
has 37672
gone 37673
for 37674
his 37675
gun! 37676
Fight!” 37677
 37678
Rikki-tikki 37679
was 37680
bounding 37681
all 37682
round 37683
Nagaina, 37684
keeping 37685
just 37686
out 37687
of 37688
reach 37689
of 37690
her 37691
stroke, 37692
his 37693
little 37694
eyes 37695
like 37696
hot 37697
coals. 37698
Nagaina 37699
gathered 37700
herself 37701
together 37702
and 37703
flung 37704
out 37705
at 37706
him. 37707
Rikki-tikki 37708
jumped 37709
up 37710
and 37711
backward. 37712
Again 37713
and 37714
again 37715
and 37716
again 37717
she 37718
struck, 37719
and 37720
each 37721
time 37722
her 37723
head 37724
came 37725
with 37726
a 37727
whack 37728
on 37729
the 37730
matting 37731
of 37732
the 37733
veranda 37734
and 37735
she 37736
gathered 37737
herself 37738
together 37739
like 37740
a 37741
watch 37742
spring. 37743
Then 37744
Rikki-tikki 37745
danced 37746
in 37747
a 37748
circle 37749
to 37750
get 37751
behind 37752
her, 37753
and 37754
Nagaina 37755
spun 37756
round 37757
to 37758
keep 37759
her 37760
head 37761
to 37762
his 37763
head, 37764
so 37765
that 37766
the 37767
rustle 37768
of 37769
her 37770
tail 37771
on 37772
the 37773
matting 37774
sounded 37775
like 37776
dry 37777
leaves 37778
blown 37779
along 37780
by 37781
the 37782
wind. 37783
 37784
He 37785
had 37786
forgotten 37787
the 37788
egg. 37789
It 37790
still 37791
lay 37792
on 37793
the 37794
veranda, 37795
and 37796
Nagaina 37797
came 37798
nearer 37799
and 37800
nearer 37801
to 37802
it, 37803
till 37804
at 37805
last, 37806
while 37807
Rikki-tikki 37808
was 37809
drawing 37810
breath, 37811
she 37812
caught 37813
it 37814
in 37815
her 37816
mouth, 37817
turned 37818
to 37819
the 37820
veranda 37821
steps, 37822
and 37823
flew 37824
like 37825
an 37826
arrow 37827
down 37828
the 37829
path, 37830
with 37831
Rikki-tikki 37832
behind 37833
her. 37834
When 37835
the 37836
cobra 37837
runs 37838
for 37839
her 37840
life, 37841
she 37842
goes 37843
like 37844
a 37845
whip-lash 37846
flicked 37847
across 37848
a 37849
horse’s 37850
neck. 37851
 37852
Rikki-tikki 37853
knew 37854
that 37855
he 37856
must 37857
catch 37858
her, 37859
or 37860
all 37861
the 37862
trouble 37863
would 37864
begin 37865
again. 37866
She 37867
headed 37868
straight 37869
for 37870
the 37871
long 37872
grass 37873
by 37874
the 37875
thorn-bush, 37876
and 37877
as 37878
he 37879
was 37880
running 37881
Rikki-tikki 37882
heard 37883
Darzee 37884
still 37885
singing 37886
his 37887
foolish 37888
little 37889
song 37890
of 37891
triumph. 37892
But 37893
Darzee’s 37894
wife 37895
was 37896
wiser. 37897
She 37898
flew 37899
off 37900
her 37901
nest 37902
as 37903
Nagaina 37904
came 37905
along, 37906
and 37907
flapped 37908
her 37909
wings 37910
about 37911
Nagaina’s 37912
head. 37913
If 37914
Darzee 37915
had 37916
helped 37917
they 37918
might 37919
have 37920
turned 37921
her, 37922
but 37923
Nagaina 37924
only 37925
lowered 37926
her 37927
hood 37928
and 37929
went 37930
on. 37931
Still, 37932
the 37933
instant’s 37934
delay 37935
brought 37936
Rikki-tikki 37937
up 37938
to 37939
her, 37940
and 37941
as 37942
she 37943
plunged 37944
into 37945
the 37946
rat-hole 37947
where 37948
she 37949
and 37950
Nag 37951
used 37952
to 37953
live, 37954
his 37955
little 37956
white 37957
teeth 37958
were 37959
clenched 37960
on 37961
her 37962
tail, 37963
and 37964
he 37965
went 37966
down 37967
with 37968
her--and 37969
very 37970
few 37971
mongooses, 37972
however 37973
wise 37974
and 37975
old 37976
they 37977
may 37978
be, 37979
care 37980
to 37981
follow 37982
a 37983
cobra 37984
into 37985
its 37986
hole. 37987
It 37988
was 37989
dark 37990
in 37991
the 37992
hole; 37993
and 37994
Rikki-tikki 37995
never 37996
knew 37997
when 37998
it 37999
might 38000
open 38001
out 38002
and 38003
give 38004
Nagaina 38005
room 38006
to 38007
turn 38008
and 38009
strike 38010
at 38011
him. 38012
He 38013
held 38014
on 38015
savagely, 38016
and 38017
stuck 38018
out 38019
his 38020
feet 38021
to 38022
act 38023
as 38024
brakes 38025
on 38026
the 38027
dark 38028
slope 38029
of 38030
the 38031
hot, 38032
moist 38033
earth. 38034
 38035
Then 38036
the 38037
grass 38038
by 38039
the 38040
mouth 38041
of 38042
the 38043
hole 38044
stopped 38045
waving, 38046
and 38047
Darzee 38048
said, 38049
“It 38050
is 38051
all 38052
over 38053
with 38054
Rikki-tikki! 38055
We 38056
must 38057
sing 38058
his 38059
death 38060
song. 38061
Valiant 38062
Rikki-tikki 38063
is 38064
dead! 38065
For 38066
Nagaina 38067
will 38068
surely 38069
kill 38070
him 38071
underground.” 38072
 38073
So 38074
he 38075
sang 38076
a 38077
very 38078
mournful 38079
song 38080
that 38081
he 38082
made 38083
up 38084
on 38085
the 38086
spur 38087
of 38088
the 38089
minute, 38090
and 38091
just 38092
as 38093
he 38094
got 38095
to 38096
the 38097
most 38098
touching 38099
part, 38100
the 38101
grass 38102
quivered 38103
again, 38104
and 38105
Rikki-tikki, 38106
covered 38107
with 38108
dirt, 38109
dragged 38110
himself 38111
out 38112
of 38113
the 38114
hole 38115
leg 38116
by 38117
leg, 38118
licking 38119
his 38120
whiskers. 38121
Darzee 38122
stopped 38123
with 38124
a 38125
little 38126
shout. 38127
Rikki-tikki 38128
shook 38129
some 38130
of 38131
the 38132
dust 38133
out 38134
of 38135
his 38136
fur 38137
and 38138
sneezed. 38139
“It 38140
is 38141
all 38142
over,” 38143
he 38144
said. 38145
“The 38146
widow 38147
will 38148
never 38149
come 38150
out 38151
again.” 38152
And 38153
the 38154
red 38155
ants 38156
that 38157
live 38158
between 38159
the 38160
grass 38161
stems 38162
heard 38163
him, 38164
and 38165
began 38166
to 38167
troop 38168
down 38169
one 38170
after 38171
another 38172
to 38173
see 38174
if 38175
he 38176
had 38177
spoken 38178
the 38179
truth. 38180
 38181
Rikki-tikki 38182
curled 38183
himself 38184
up 38185
in 38186
the 38187
grass 38188
and 38189
slept 38190
where 38191
he 38192
was--slept 38193
and 38194
slept 38195
till 38196
it 38197
was 38198
late 38199
in 38200
the 38201
afternoon, 38202
for 38203
he 38204
had 38205
done 38206
a 38207
hard 38208
day’s 38209
work. 38210
 38211
“Now,” 38212
he 38213
said, 38214
when 38215
he 38216
awoke, 38217
“I 38218
will 38219
go 38220
back 38221
to 38222
the 38223
house. 38224
Tell 38225
the 38226
Coppersmith, 38227
Darzee, 38228
and 38229
he 38230
will 38231
tell 38232
the 38233
garden 38234
that 38235
Nagaina 38236
is 38237
dead.” 38238
 38239
The 38240
Coppersmith 38241
is 38242
a 38243
bird 38244
who 38245
makes 38246
a 38247
noise 38248
exactly 38249
like 38250
the 38251
beating 38252
of 38253
a 38254
little 38255
hammer 38256
on 38257
a 38258
copper 38259
pot; 38260
and 38261
the 38262
reason 38263
he 38264
is 38265
always 38266
making 38267
it 38268
is 38269
because 38270
he 38271
is 38272
the 38273
town 38274
crier 38275
to 38276
every 38277
Indian 38278
garden, 38279
and 38280
tells 38281
all 38282
the 38283
news 38284
to 38285
everybody 38286
who 38287
cares 38288
to 38289
listen. 38290
As 38291
Rikki-tikki 38292
went 38293
up 38294
the 38295
path, 38296
he 38297
heard 38298
his 38299
“attention” 38300
notes 38301
like 38302
a 38303
tiny 38304
dinner 38305
gong, 38306
and 38307
then 38308
the 38309
steady 38310
“Ding-dong-tock! 38311
Nag 38312
is 38313
dead--dong! 38314
Nagaina 38315
is 38316
dead! 38317
Ding-dong-tock!” 38318
That 38319
set 38320
all 38321
the 38322
birds 38323
in 38324
the 38325
garden 38326
singing, 38327
and 38328
the 38329
frogs 38330
croaking, 38331
for 38332
Nag 38333
and 38334
Nagaina 38335
used 38336
to 38337
eat 38338
frogs 38339
as 38340
well 38341
as 38342
little 38343
birds. 38344
 38345
When 38346
Rikki 38347
got 38348
to 38349
the 38350
house, 38351
Teddy 38352
and 38353
Teddy’s 38354
mother 38355
(she 38356
looked 38357
very 38358
white 38359
still, 38360
for 38361
she 38362
had 38363
been 38364
fainting) 38365
and 38366
Teddy’s 38367
father 38368
came 38369
out 38370
and 38371
almost 38372
cried 38373
over 38374
him; 38375
and 38376
that 38377
night 38378
he 38379
ate 38380
all 38381
that 38382
was 38383
given 38384
him 38385
till 38386
he 38387
could 38388
eat 38389
no 38390
more, 38391
and 38392
went 38393
to 38394
bed 38395
on 38396
Teddy’s 38397
shoulder, 38398
where 38399
Teddy’s 38400
mother 38401
saw 38402
him 38403
when 38404
she 38405
came 38406
to 38407
look 38408
late 38409
at 38410
night. 38411
 38412
“He 38413
saved 38414
our 38415
lives 38416
and 38417
Teddy’s 38418
life,” 38419
she 38420
said 38421
to 38422
her 38423
husband. 38424
“Just 38425
think, 38426
he 38427
saved 38428
all 38429
our 38430
lives.” 38431
 38432
Rikki-tikki 38433
woke 38434
up 38435
with 38436
a 38437
jump, 38438
for 38439
the 38440
mongooses 38441
are 38442
light 38443
sleepers. 38444
 38445
“Oh, 38446
it’s 38447
you,” 38448
said 38449
he. 38450
“What 38451
are 38452
you 38453
bothering 38454
for? 38455
All 38456
the 38457
cobras 38458
are 38459
dead. 38460
And 38461
if 38462
they 38463
weren’t, 38464
I’m 38465
here.” 38466
 38467
Rikki-tikki 38468
had 38469
a 38470
right 38471
to 38472
be 38473
proud 38474
of 38475
himself. 38476
But 38477
he 38478
did 38479
not 38480
grow 38481
too 38482
proud, 38483
and 38484
he 38485
kept 38486
that 38487
garden 38488
as 38489
a 38490
mongoose 38491
should 38492
keep 38493
it, 38494
with 38495
tooth 38496
and 38497
jump 38498
and 38499
spring 38500
and 38501
bite, 38502
till 38503
never 38504
a 38505
cobra 38506
dared 38507
show 38508
its 38509
head 38510
inside 38511
the 38512

served 39006
the 39007
Indian 39008
Government 39009
in 39010
every 39011
way 39012
that 39013

could 39016
serve 39017
it 39018
for 39019
forty-seven 39020
years, 39021
and 39022
as 39023
he 39024
was 39025
fully 39026
twenty 39027
years 39028
old 39029
when 39030
he 39031
was 39032
caught, 39033
that 39034
makes 39035
him 39036
nearly 39037
seventy--a 39038
ripe 39039
age 39040
for 39041
an 39042
elephant. 39043
He 39044
remembered 39045
pushing, 39046
with 39047
a 39048
big 39049
leather 39050
pad 39051
on 39052
his 39053
forehead, 39054
at 39055
a 39056
gun 39057
stuck 39058
in 39059
deep 39060
mud, 39061
and 39062
that 39063
was 39064
before 39065
the 39066
Afghan 39067
War 39068
of 39069
1842, 39070
and 39071
he 39072
had 39073
not 39074
then 39075
come 39076
to 39077
his 39078
full 39079
strength. 39080
 39081
His 39082
mother 39083
Radha 39084
Pyari,--Radha 39085
the 39086
darling,--who 39087
had 39088
been 39089
caught 39090
in 39091
the 39092
same 39093
drive 39094
with 39095
Kala 39096
Nag, 39097
told 39098
him, 39099
before 39100
his 39101
little 39102
milk 39103
tusks 39104
had 39105
dropped 39106
out, 39107
that 39108
elephants 39109
who 39110
were 39111
afraid 39112
always 39113
got 39114
hurt. 39115
Kala 39116
Nag 39117
knew 39118
that 39119
that 39120
advice 39121
was 39122
good, 39123
for 39124
the 39125
first 39126
time 39127
that 39128
he 39129
saw 39130
a 39131
shell 39132
burst 39133
he 39134
backed, 39135
screaming, 39136
into 39137
a 39138
stand 39139
of 39140
piled 39141
rifles, 39142
and 39143
the 39144
bayonets 39145
pricked 39146
him 39147
in 39148
all 39149
his 39150
softest 39151
places. 39152
So, 39153
before 39154
he 39155
was 39156
twenty-five, 39157
he 39158
gave 39159
up 39160
being 39161
afraid, 39162
and 39163
so 39164
he 39165
was 39166
the 39167
best-loved 39168
and 39169
the 39170
best-looked-after 39171
elephant 39172
in 39173
the 39174
service 39175
of 39176
the 39177
Government 39178
of 39179
India. 39180
He 39181
had 39182
carried 39183
tents, 39184
twelve 39185
hundred 39186
pounds’ 39187
weight 39188
of 39189
tents, 39190
on 39191
the 39192
march 39193
in 39194
Upper 39195
India. 39196
He 39197
had 39198
been 39199
hoisted 39200
into 39201
a 39202
ship 39203
at 39204
the 39205
end 39206
of 39207
a 39208
steam 39209
crane 39210
and 39211
taken 39212
for 39213
days 39214
across 39215
the 39216
water, 39217
and 39218
made 39219
to 39220
carry 39221
a 39222
mortar 39223
on 39224
his 39225
back 39226
in 39227
a 39228
strange 39229
and 39230
rocky 39231
country 39232
very 39233
far 39234
from 39235
India, 39236
and 39237
had 39238
seen 39239
the 39240
Emperor 39241
Theodore 39242
lying 39243
dead 39244
in 39245
Magdala, 39246
and 39247
had 39248
come 39249
back 39250
again 39251
in 39252
the 39253
steamer 39254
entitled, 39255
so 39256
the 39257
soldiers 39258
said, 39259
to 39260
the 39261
Abyssinian 39262
War 39263
medal. 39264
He 39265
had 39266
seen 39267
his 39268
fellow 39269
elephants 39270
die 39271
of 39272
cold 39273
and 39274
epilepsy 39275
and 39276
starvation 39277
and 39278
sunstroke 39279
up 39280
at 39281
a 39282
place 39283
called 39284
Ali 39285
Musjid, 39286
ten 39287
years 39288
later; 39289
and 39290
afterward 39291
he 39292
had 39293
been 39294
sent 39295
down 39296
thousands 39297
of 39298
miles 39299
south 39300
to 39301
haul 39302
and 39303
pile 39304
big 39305
balks 39306
of 39307
teak 39308
in 39309
the 39310
timberyards 39311
at 39312
Moulmein. 39313
There 39314
he 39315
had 39316
half 39317
killed 39318
an 39319
insubordinate 39320
young 39321
elephant 39322
who 39323
was 39324
shirking 39325
his 39326
fair 39327
share 39328
of 39329
work. 39330
 39331
After 39332
that 39333
he 39334
was 39335
taken 39336
off 39337
timber-hauling, 39338
and 39339
employed, 39340
with 39341
a 39342
few 39343
score 39344
other 39345
elephants 39346
who 39347
were 39348
trained 39349
to 39350
the 39351
business, 39352
in 39353
helping 39354
to 39355
catch 39356
wild 39357
elephants 39358
among 39359
the 39360
Garo 39361
hills. 39362
Elephants 39363
are 39364
very 39365
strictly 39366
preserved 39367
by 39368
the 39369
Indian 39370
Government. 39371
There 39372
is 39373
one 39374
whole 39375
department 39376
which 39377
does 39378
nothing 39379
else 39380
but 39381
hunt 39382
them, 39383
and 39384
catch 39385
them, 39386
and 39387
break 39388
them 39389
in, 39390
and 39391
send 39392
them 39393
up 39394
and 39395
down 39396
the 39397
country 39398
as 39399
they 39400
are 39401
needed 39402
for 39403
work. 39404
 39405
Kala 39406
Nag 39407
stood 39408
ten 39409
fair 39410
feet 39411
at 39412
the 39413
shoulders, 39414
and 39415
his 39416
tusks 39417
had 39418
been 39419
cut 39420
off 39421
short 39422
at 39423
five 39424
feet, 39425
and 39426
bound 39427
round 39428
the 39429
ends, 39430
to 39431
prevent 39432
them 39433
splitting, 39434
with 39435
bands 39436
of 39437
copper; 39438
but 39439
he 39440
could 39441
do 39442
more 39443
with 39444
those 39445
stumps 39446
than 39447
any 39448
untrained 39449
elephant 39450
could 39451
do 39452
with 39453
the 39454
real 39455
sharpened 39456
ones. 39457
When, 39458
after 39459
weeks 39460
and 39461
weeks 39462
of 39463
cautious 39464
driving 39465
of 39466
scattered 39467
elephants 39468
across 39469
the 39470
hills, 39471
the 39472
forty 39473
or 39474
fifty 39475
wild 39476
monsters 39477
were 39478
driven 39479
into 39480
the 39481
last 39482
stockade, 39483
and 39484
the 39485
big 39486
drop 39487
gate, 39488
made 39489
of 39490
tree 39491
trunks 39492
lashed 39493
together, 39494
jarred 39495
down 39496
behind 39497
them, 39498
Kala 39499
Nag, 39500
at 39501
the 39502
word 39503
of 39504
command, 39505
would 39506
go 39507
into 39508
that 39509
flaring, 39510
trumpeting 39511
pandemonium 39512
(generally 39513
at 39514
night, 39515
when 39516
the 39517
flicker 39518
of 39519
the 39520
torches 39521
made 39522
it 39523
difficult 39524
to 39525
judge 39526
distances), 39527
and, 39528
picking 39529
out 39530
the 39531
biggest 39532
and 39533
wildest 39534
tusker 39535
of 39536
the 39537
mob, 39538
would 39539
hammer 39540
him 39541
and 39542
hustle 39543
him 39544
into 39545
quiet 39546
while 39547
the 39548
men 39549
on 39550
the 39551
backs 39552
of 39553
the 39554
other 39555
elephants 39556
roped 39557
and 39558
tied 39559
the 39560
smaller 39561
ones. 39562
 39563
There 39564
was 39565
nothing 39566
in 39567
the 39568
way 39569
of 39570
fighting 39571
that 39572
Kala 39573
Nag, 39574
the 39575
old 39576
wise 39577
Black 39578
Snake, 39579
did 39580
not 39581
know, 39582
for 39583
he 39584
had 39585
stood 39586
up 39587
more 39588
than 39589
once 39590
in 39591
his 39592
time 39593
to 39594
the 39595
charge 39596
of 39597
the 39598
wounded 39599
tiger, 39600
and, 39601
curling 39602
up 39603
his 39604
soft 39605
trunk 39606
to 39607
be 39608
out 39609
of 39610
harm’s 39611
way, 39612
had 39613
knocked 39614
the 39615
springing 39616
brute 39617
sideways 39618
in 39619
mid-air 39620
with 39621
a 39622
quick 39623
sickle 39624
cut 39625
of 39626
his 39627
head, 39628
that 39629
he 39630
had 39631
invented 39632
all 39633
by 39634
himself; 39635
had 39636
knocked 39637
him 39638
over, 39639
and 39640
kneeled 39641
upon 39642
him 39643
with 39644
his 39645
huge 39646
knees 39647
till 39648
the 39649
life 39650
went 39651
out 39652
with 39653
a 39654
gasp 39655
and 39656
a 39657
howl, 39658
and 39659
there 39660
was 39661
only 39662
a 39663
fluffy 39664
striped 39665
thing 39666
on 39667
the 39668
ground 39669
for 39670
Kala 39671
Nag 39672
to 39673
pull 39674
by 39675
the 39676
tail. 39677
 39678
“Yes,” 39679
said 39680
Big 39681
Toomai, 39682
his 39683
driver, 39684
the 39685
son 39686
of 39687
Black 39688
Toomai 39689
who 39690
had 39691
taken 39692
him 39693
to 39694
Abyssinia, 39695
and 39696
grandson 39697
of 39698
Toomai 39699
of 39700
the 39701
Elephants 39702
who 39703
had 39704
seen 39705
him 39706
caught, 39707
“there 39708
is 39709
nothing 39710
that 39711
the 39712
Black 39713
Snake 39714
fears 39715
except 39716
me. 39717
He 39718
has 39719
seen 39720
three 39721
generations 39722
of 39723
us 39724
feed 39725
him 39726
and 39727
groom 39728
him, 39729
and 39730
he 39731
will 39732
live 39733
to 39734
see 39735
four.” 39736
 39737
“He 39738
is 39739
afraid 39740
of 39741
me 39742
also,” 39743
said 39744
Little 39745
Toomai, 39746
standing 39747
up 39748
to 39749
his 39750
full 39751
height 39752
of 39753
four 39754
feet, 39755
with 39756
only 39757
one 39758
rag 39759
upon 39760
him. 39761
He 39762
was 39763
ten 39764
years 39765
old, 39766
the 39767
eldest 39768
son 39769
of 39770
Big 39771
Toomai, 39772
and, 39773
according 39774
to 39775
custom, 39776
he 39777
would 39778
take 39779
his 39780
father’s 39781
place 39782
on 39783
Kala 39784
Nag’s 39785
neck 39786
when 39787
he 39788
grew 39789
up, 39790
and 39791
would 39792
handle 39793
the 39794
heavy 39795
iron 39796
ankus, 39797
the 39798
elephant 39799
goad, 39800
that 39801
had 39802
been 39803
worn 39804
smooth 39805
by 39806
his 39807
father, 39808
and 39809
his 39810
grandfather, 39811
and 39812
his 39813
great-grandfather. 39814
 39815
He 39816
knew 39817
what 39818
he 39819
was 39820
talking 39821
of; 39822
for 39823
he 39824
had 39825
been 39826
born 39827
under 39828
Kala 39829
Nag’s 39830
shadow, 39831
had 39832
played 39833
with 39834
the 39835
end 39836
of 39837
his 39838
trunk 39839
before 39840
he 39841
could 39842
walk, 39843
had 39844
taken 39845
him 39846
down 39847
to 39848
water 39849
as 39850
soon 39851
as 39852
he 39853
could 39854
walk, 39855
and 39856
Kala 39857
Nag 39858
would 39859
no 39860
more 39861
have 39862
dreamed 39863
of 39864
disobeying 39865
his 39866
shrill 39867
little 39868
orders 39869
than 39870
he 39871
would 39872
have 39873
dreamed 39874
of 39875
killing 39876
him 39877
on 39878
that 39879
day 39880
when 39881
Big 39882
Toomai 39883
carried 39884
the 39885
little 39886
brown 39887
baby 39888
under 39889
Kala 39890
Nag’s 39891
tusks, 39892
and 39893
told 39894
him 39895
to 39896
salute 39897
his 39898
master 39899
that 39900
was 39901
to 39902
be. 39903
 39904
“Yes,” 39905
said 39906
Little 39907
Toomai, 39908
“he 39909
is 39910
afraid 39911
of 39912
me,” 39913
and 39914
he 39915
took 39916
long 39917
strides 39918
up 39919
to 39920
Kala 39921
Nag, 39922
called 39923
him 39924
a 39925
fat 39926
old 39927
pig, 39928
and 39929
made 39930
him 39931
lift 39932
up 39933
his 39934
feet 39935
one 39936
after 39937
the 39938
other. 39939
 39940
“Wah!” 39941
said 39942
Little 39943
Toomai, 39944
“thou 39945
art 39946
a 39947
big 39948
elephant,” 39949
and 39950
he 39951
wagged 39952
his 39953
fluffy 39954
head, 39955
quoting 39956
his 39957
father. 39958
“The 39959
Government 39960
may 39961
pay 39962
for 39963
elephants, 39964
but 39965
they 39966
belong 39967
to 39968
us 39969
mahouts. 39970
When 39971
thou 39972
art 39973
old, 39974
Kala 39975
Nag, 39976
there 39977
will 39978
come 39979
some 39980
rich 39981
rajah, 39982
and 39983
he 39984
will 39985
buy 39986
thee 39987
from 39988
the 39989
Government, 39990
on 39991
account 39992
of 39993
thy 39994
size 39995
and 39996
thy 39997
manners, 39998
and 39999
then 40000
thou 40001
wilt 40002
have 40003
nothing 40004
to 40005
do 40006
but 40007
to 40008
carry 40009
gold 40010
earrings 40011
in 40012
thy 40013
ears, 40014
and 40015
a 40016
gold 40017
howdah 40018
on 40019
thy 40020
back, 40021
and 40022
a 40023
red 40024
cloth 40025
covered 40026
with 40027
gold 40028
on 40029
thy 40030
sides, 40031
and 40032
walk 40033
at 40034
the 40035
head 40036
of 40037
the 40038
processions 40039
of 40040
the 40041
King. 40042
Then 40043
I 40044
shall 40045
sit 40046
on 40047
thy 40048
neck, 40049
O 40050
Kala 40051
Nag, 40052
with 40053
a 40054
silver 40055
ankus, 40056
and 40057
men 40058
will 40059
run 40060
before 40061
us 40062
with 40063
golden 40064
sticks, 40065
crying, 40066
`Room 40067
for 40068
the 40069
King’s 40070
elephant!’ 40071
That 40072
will 40073
be 40074
good, 40075
Kala 40076
Nag, 40077
but 40078
not 40079
so 40080
good 40081
as 40082
this 40083
hunting 40084
in 40085
the 40086
jungles.” 40087
 40088
“Umph!” 40089
said 40090
Big 40091
Toomai. 40092
“Thou 40093
art 40094
a 40095
boy, 40096
and 40097
as 40098
wild 40099
as 40100
a 40101
buffalo-calf. 40102
This 40103
running 40104
up 40105
and 40106
down 40107
among 40108
the 40109
hills 40110
is 40111
not 40112
the 40113
best 40114
Government 40115
service. 40116
I 40117
am 40118
getting 40119
old, 40120
and 40121
I 40122
do 40123
not 40124
love 40125
wild 40126
elephants. 40127
Give 40128
me 40129
brick 40130
elephant 40131
lines, 40132
one 40133
stall 40134
to 40135
each 40136
elephant, 40137
and 40138
big 40139
stumps 40140
to 40141
tie 40142
them 40143
to 40144
safely, 40145
and 40146
flat, 40147
broad 40148
roads 40149
to 40150
exercise 40151
upon, 40152
instead 40153
of 40154
this 40155
come-and-go 40156
camping. 40157
Aha, 40158
the 40159
Cawnpore 40160
barracks 40161
were 40162
good. 40163
There 40164
was 40165
a 40166
bazaar 40167
close 40168
by, 40169
and 40170
only 40171
three 40172
hours’ 40173
work 40174
a 40175
day.” 40176
 40177
Little 40178
Toomai 40179
remembered 40180
the 40181
Cawnpore 40182
elephant-lines 40183
and 40184
said 40185
nothing. 40186
He 40187
very 40188
much 40189
preferred 40190
the 40191
camp 40192
life, 40193
and 40194
hated 40195
those 40196
broad, 40197
flat 40198
roads, 40199
with 40200
the 40201
daily 40202
grubbing 40203
for 40204
grass 40205
in 40206
the 40207
forage 40208
reserve, 40209
and 40210
the 40211
long 40212
hours 40213
when 40214
there 40215
was 40216
nothing 40217
to 40218
do 40219
except 40220
to 40221
watch 40222
Kala 40223
Nag 40224
fidgeting 40225
in 40226
his 40227
pickets. 40228
 40229
What 40230
Little 40231
Toomai 40232
liked 40233
was 40234
to 40235
scramble 40236
up 40237
bridle 40238
paths 40239
that 40240
only 40241
an 40242
elephant 40243
could 40244
take; 40245
the 40246
dip 40247
into 40248
the 40249
valley 40250
below; 40251
the 40252
glimpses 40253
of 40254
the 40255
wild 40256
elephants 40257
browsing 40258
miles 40259
away; 40260
the 40261
rush 40262
of 40263
the 40264
frightened 40265
pig 40266
and 40267
peacock 40268
under 40269
Kala 40270
Nag’s 40271
feet; 40272
the 40273
blinding 40274
warm 40275
rains, 40276
when 40277
all 40278
the 40279
hills 40280
and 40281
valleys 40282
smoked; 40283
the 40284
beautiful 40285
misty 40286
mornings 40287
when 40288
nobody 40289
knew 40290
where 40291
they 40292
would 40293
camp 40294
that 40295
night; 40296
the 40297
steady, 40298
cautious 40299
drive 40300
of 40301
the 40302
wild 40303
elephants, 40304
and 40305
the 40306
mad 40307
rush 40308
and 40309
blaze 40310
and 40311
hullabaloo 40312
of 40313
the 40314
last 40315
night’s 40316
drive, 40317
when 40318
the 40319
elephants 40320
poured 40321
into 40322
the 40323
stockade 40324
like 40325
boulders 40326
in 40327
a 40328
landslide, 40329
found 40330
that 40331
they 40332
could 40333
not 40334
get 40335
out, 40336
and 40337
flung 40338
themselves 40339
at 40340
the 40341
heavy 40342
posts 40343
only 40344
to 40345
be 40346
driven 40347
back 40348
by 40349
yells 40350
and 40351
flaring 40352
torches 40353
and 40354
volleys 40355
of 40356
blank 40357
cartridge. 40358
 40359
Even 40360
a 40361
little 40362
boy 40363
could 40364
be 40365
of 40366
use 40367
there, 40368
and 40369
Toomai 40370
was 40371
as 40372
useful 40373
as 40374
three 40375
boys. 40376
He 40377
would 40378
get 40379
his 40380
torch 40381
and 40382
wave 40383
it, 40384
and 40385
yell 40386
with 40387
the 40388
best. 40389
But 40390
the 40391
really 40392
good 40393
time 40394
came 40395
when 40396
the 40397
driving 40398
out 40399
began, 40400
and 40401
the 40402
Keddah--that 40403
is, 40404
the 40405
stockade--looked 40406
like 40407
a 40408
picture 40409
of 40410
the 40411
end 40412
of 40413
the 40414
world, 40415
and 40416
men 40417
had 40418
to 40419
make 40420
signs 40421
to 40422
one 40423
another, 40424
because 40425
they 40426
could 40427
not 40428
hear 40429
themselves 40430
speak. 40431
Then 40432
Little 40433
Toomai 40434
would 40435
climb 40436
up 40437
to 40438
the 40439
top 40440
of 40441
one 40442
of 40443
the 40444
quivering 40445
stockade 40446
posts, 40447
his 40448
sun-bleached 40449
brown 40450
hair 40451
flying 40452
loose 40453
all 40454
over 40455
his 40456
shoulders, 40457
and 40458
he 40459
looking 40460
like 40461
a 40462
goblin 40463
in 40464
the 40465
torch-light. 40466
And 40467
as 40468
soon 40469
as 40470
there 40471
was 40472
a 40473
lull 40474
you 40475
could 40476
hear 40477
his 40478
high-pitched 40479
yells 40480
of 40481
encouragement 40482
to 40483
Kala 40484
Nag, 40485
above 40486
the 40487
trumpeting 40488
and 40489
crashing, 40490
and 40491
snapping 40492
of 40493
ropes, 40494
and 40495
groans 40496
of 40497
the 40498
tethered 40499
elephants. 40500
“Mael, 40501
mael, 40502
Kala 40503
Nag! 40504
(Go 40505
on, 40506
go 40507
on, 40508
Black 40509
Snake!) 40510
Dant 40511
do! 40512
(Give 40513
him 40514
the 40515
tusk!) 40516
Somalo! 40517
Somalo! 40518
(Careful, 40519
careful!) 40520
Maro! 40521
Mar! 40522
(Hit 40523
him, 40524
hit 40525
him!) 40526
Mind 40527
the 40528
post! 40529
Arre! 40530
Arre! 40531
Hai! 40532
Yai! 40533
Kya-a-ah!” 40534
he 40535
would 40536
shout, 40537
and 40538
the 40539
big 40540
fight 40541
between 40542
Kala 40543
Nag 40544
and 40545
the 40546
wild 40547
elephant 40548
would 40549
sway 40550
to 40551
and 40552
fro 40553
across 40554
the 40555
Keddah, 40556
and 40557
the 40558
old 40559
elephant 40560
catchers 40561
would 40562
wipe 40563
the 40564
sweat 40565
out 40566
of 40567
their 40568
eyes, 40569
and 40570
find 40571
time 40572
to 40573
nod 40574
to 40575
Little 40576
Toomai 40577
wriggling 40578
with 40579
joy 40580
on 40581
the 40582
top 40583
of 40584
the 40585
posts. 40586
 40587
He 40588
did 40589
more 40590
than 40591
wriggle. 40592
One 40593
night 40594
he 40595
slid 40596
down 40597
from 40598
the 40599
post 40600
and 40601
slipped 40602
in 40603
between 40604
the 40605
elephants 40606
and 40607
threw 40608
up 40609
the 40610
loose 40611
end 40612
of 40613
a 40614
rope, 40615
which 40616
had 40617
dropped, 40618
to 40619
a 40620
driver 40621
who 40622
was 40623
trying 40624
to 40625
get 40626
a 40627
purchase 40628
on 40629
the 40630
leg 40631
of 40632
a 40633
kicking 40634
young 40635
calf 40636
(calves 40637
always 40638
give 40639
more 40640
trouble 40641
than 40642
full-grown 40643
animals). 40644
Kala 40645
Nag 40646
saw 40647
him, 40648
caught 40649
him 40650
in 40651
his 40652
trunk, 40653
and 40654
handed 40655
him 40656
up 40657
to 40658
Big 40659
Toomai, 40660
who 40661
slapped 40662
him 40663
then 40664
and 40665
there, 40666
and 40667
put 40668
him 40669
back 40670
on 40671
the 40672
post. 40673
 40674
Next 40675
morning 40676
he 40677
gave 40678
him 40679
a 40680
scolding 40681
and 40682
said, 40683
“Are 40684
not 40685
good 40686
brick 40687
elephant 40688
lines 40689
and 40690
a 40691
little 40692
tent 40693
carrying 40694
enough, 40695
that 40696
thou 40697
must 40698
needs 40699
go 40700
elephant 40701
catching 40702
on 40703
thy 40704
own 40705
account, 40706
little 40707
worthless? 40708
Now 40709
those 40710
foolish 40711
hunters, 40712
whose 40713
pay 40714
is 40715
less 40716
than 40717
my 40718
pay, 40719
have 40720
spoken 40721
to 40722
Petersen 40723
Sahib 40724
of 40725
the 40726
matter.” 40727
Little 40728
Toomai 40729
was 40730
frightened. 40731
He 40732
did 40733
not 40734
know 40735
much 40736
of 40737
white 40738
men, 40739
but 40740
Petersen 40741
Sahib 40742
was 40743
the 40744
greatest 40745
white 40746
man 40747
in 40748
the 40749
world 40750
to 40751
him. 40752
He 40753
was 40754
the 40755
head 40756
of 40757
all 40758
the 40759
Keddah 40760
operations--the 40761
man 40762
who 40763
caught 40764
all 40765
the 40766
elephants 40767
for 40768
the 40769
Government 40770
of 40771
India, 40772
and 40773
who 40774
knew 40775
more 40776
about 40777
the 40778
ways 40779
of 40780
elephants 40781
than 40782
any 40783
living 40784
man. 40785
 40786
“What--what 40787
will 40788
happen?” 40789
said 40790
Little 40791
Toomai. 40792
 40793
“Happen! 40794
The 40795
worst 40796
that 40797
can 40798
happen. 40799
Petersen 40800
Sahib 40801
is 40802
a 40803
madman. 40804
Else 40805
why 40806
should 40807
he 40808
go 40809
hunting 40810
these 40811
wild 40812
devils? 40813
He 40814
may 40815
even 40816
require 40817
thee 40818
to 40819
be 40820
an 40821
elephant 40822
catcher, 40823
to 40824
sleep 40825
anywhere 40826
in 40827
these 40828
fever-filled 40829
jungles, 40830
and 40831
at 40832
last 40833
to 40834
be 40835
trampled 40836
to 40837
death 40838
in 40839
the 40840
Keddah. 40841
It 40842
is 40843
well 40844
that 40845
this 40846
nonsense 40847
ends 40848
safely. 40849
Next 40850
week 40851
the 40852
catching 40853
is 40854
over, 40855
and 40856
we 40857
of 40858
the 40859
plains 40860
are 40861
sent 40862
back 40863
to 40864
our 40865
stations. 40866
Then 40867
we 40868
will 40869
march 40870
on 40871
smooth 40872
roads, 40873
and 40874
forget 40875
all 40876
this 40877
hunting. 40878
But, 40879
son, 40880
I 40881
am 40882
angry 40883
that 40884
thou 40885
shouldst 40886
meddle 40887
in 40888
the 40889
business 40890
that 40891
belongs 40892
to 40893
these 40894
dirty 40895
Assamese 40896
jungle 40897
folk. 40898
Kala 40899
Nag 40900
will 40901
obey 40902
none 40903
but 40904
me, 40905
so 40906
I 40907
must 40908
go 40909
with 40910
him 40911
into 40912
the 40913
Keddah, 40914
but 40915
he 40916
is 40917
only 40918
a 40919
fighting 40920
elephant, 40921
and 40922
he 40923
does 40924
not 40925
help 40926
to 40927
rope 40928
them. 40929
So 40930
I 40931
sit 40932
at 40933
my 40934
ease, 40935
as 40936
befits 40937
a 40938
mahout,--not 40939
a 40940
mere 40941
hunter,--a 40942
mahout, 40943
I 40944
say, 40945
and 40946
a 40947
man 40948
who 40949
gets 40950
a 40951
pension 40952
at 40953
the 40954
end 40955
of 40956
his 40957
service. 40958
Is 40959
the 40960
family 40961
of 40962
Toomai 40963
of 40964
the 40965
Elephants 40966
to 40967
be 40968
trodden 40969
underfoot 40970
in 40971
the 40972
dirt 40973
of 40974
a 40975
Keddah? 40976
Bad 40977
one! 40978
Wicked 40979
one! 40980
Worthless 40981
son! 40982
Go 40983
and 40984
wash 40985
Kala 40986
Nag 40987
and 40988
attend 40989
to 40990
his 40991
ears, 40992
and 40993
see 40994
that 40995
there 40996
are 40997
no 40998
thorns 40999
in 41000
his 41001
feet. 41002
Or 41003
else 41004
Petersen 41005
Sahib 41006
will 41007
surely 41008
catch 41009
thee 41010
and 41011
make 41012
thee 41013
a 41014
wild 41015
hunter--a 41016
follower 41017
of 41018
elephant’s 41019
foot 41020
tracks, 41021
a 41022
jungle 41023
bear. 41024
Bah! 41025
Shame! 41026
Go!” 41027
 41028
Little 41029
Toomai 41030
went 41031
off 41032
without 41033
saying 41034
a 41035
word, 41036
but 41037
he 41038
told 41039
Kala 41040
Nag 41041
all 41042
his 41043
grievances 41044
while 41045
he 41046
was 41047
examining 41048
his 41049
feet. 41050
“No 41051
matter,” 41052
said 41053
Little 41054
Toomai, 41055
turning 41056
up 41057
the 41058
fringe 41059
of 41060
Kala 41061
Nag’s 41062
huge 41063
right 41064
ear. 41065
“They 41066
have 41067
said 41068
my 41069
name 41070
to 41071
Petersen 41072
Sahib, 41073
and 41074
perhaps--and 41075
perhaps--and 41076
perhaps--who 41077
knows? 41078
Hai! 41079
That 41080
is 41081
a 41082
big 41083
thorn 41084
that 41085
I 41086
have 41087
pulled 41088
out!” 41089
 41090
The 41091
next 41092
few 41093
days 41094
were 41095
spent 41096
in 41097
getting 41098
the 41099
elephants 41100
together, 41101
in 41102
walking 41103
the 41104
newly 41105
caught 41106
wild 41107
elephants 41108
up 41109
and 41110
down 41111
between 41112
a 41113
couple 41114
of 41115
tame 41116
ones 41117
to 41118
prevent 41119
them 41120
giving 41121
too 41122
much 41123
trouble 41124
on 41125
the 41126
downward 41127
march 41128
to 41129
the 41130
plains, 41131
and 41132
in 41133
taking 41134
stock 41135
of 41136
the 41137
blankets 41138
and 41139
ropes 41140
and 41141
things 41142
that 41143
had 41144
been 41145
worn 41146
out 41147
or 41148
lost 41149
in 41150
the 41151
forest. 41152
 41153
Petersen 41154
Sahib 41155
came 41156
in 41157
on 41158
his 41159
clever 41160
she-elephant 41161
Pudmini; 41162
he 41163
had 41164
been 41165
paying 41166
off 41167
other 41168
camps 41169
among 41170
the 41171
hills, 41172
for 41173
the 41174
season 41175
was 41176
coming 41177
to 41178
an 41179
end, 41180
and 41181
there 41182
was 41183
a 41184
native 41185
clerk 41186
sitting 41187
at 41188
a 41189
table 41190
under 41191
a 41192
tree, 41193
to 41194
pay 41195
the 41196
drivers 41197
their 41198
wages. 41199
As 41200
each 41201
man 41202
was 41203
paid 41204
he 41205
went 41206
back 41207
to 41208
his 41209
elephant, 41210
and 41211
joined 41212
the 41213
line 41214
that 41215
stood 41216
ready 41217
to 41218
start. 41219
The 41220
catchers, 41221
and 41222
hunters, 41223
and 41224
beaters, 41225
the 41226
men 41227
of 41228
the 41229
regular 41230
Keddah, 41231
who 41232
stayed 41233
in 41234
the 41235
jungle 41236
year 41237
in 41238
and 41239
year 41240
out, 41241
sat 41242
on 41243
the 41244
backs 41245
of 41246
the 41247
elephants 41248
that 41249
belonged 41250
to 41251
Petersen 41252
Sahib’s 41253
permanent 41254
force, 41255
or 41256
leaned 41257
against 41258
the 41259
trees 41260
with 41261
their 41262
guns 41263
across 41264
their 41265
arms, 41266
and 41267
made 41268
fun 41269
of 41270
the 41271
drivers 41272
who 41273
were 41274
going 41275
away, 41276
and 41277
laughed 41278
when 41279
the 41280
newly 41281
caught 41282
elephants 41283
broke 41284
the 41285
line 41286
and 41287
ran 41288
about. 41289
 41290
Big 41291
Toomai 41292
went 41293
up 41294
to 41295
the 41296
clerk 41297
with 41298
Little 41299
Toomai 41300
behind 41301
him, 41302
and 41303
Machua 41304
Appa, 41305
the 41306
head 41307
tracker, 41308
said 41309
in 41310
an 41311
undertone 41312
to 41313
a 41314
friend 41315
of 41316
his, 41317
“There 41318
goes 41319
one 41320
piece 41321
of 41322
good 41323
elephant 41324
stuff 41325
at 41326
least. 41327
’Tis 41328
a 41329
pity 41330
to 41331
send 41332
that 41333
young 41334
jungle-cock 41335
to 41336
molt 41337
in 41338
the 41339
plains.” 41340
 41341
Now 41342
Petersen 41343
Sahib 41344
had 41345
ears 41346
all 41347
over 41348
him, 41349
as 41350
a 41351
man 41352
must 41353
have 41354
who 41355
listens 41356
to 41357
the 41358
most 41359
silent 41360
of 41361
all 41362
living 41363
things--the 41364
wild 41365
elephant. 41366
He 41367
turned 41368
where 41369
he 41370
was 41371
lying 41372
all 41373
along 41374
on 41375
Pudmini’s 41376
back 41377
and 41378
said, 41379
“What 41380
is 41381
that? 41382
I 41383
did 41384
not 41385
know 41386
of 41387
a 41388
man 41389
among 41390
the 41391
plains-drivers 41392
who 41393
had 41394
wit 41395
enough 41396
to 41397
rope 41398
even 41399
a 41400
dead 41401
elephant.” 41402
 41403
“This 41404
is 41405
not 41406
a 41407
man, 41408
but 41409
a 41410
boy. 41411
He 41412
went 41413
into 41414
the 41415
Keddah 41416
at 41417
the 41418
last 41419
drive, 41420
and 41421
threw 41422
Barmao 41423
there 41424
the 41425
rope, 41426
when 41427
we 41428
were 41429
trying 41430
to 41431
get 41432
that 41433
young 41434
calf 41435
with 41436
the 41437
blotch 41438
on 41439
his 41440
shoulder 41441
away 41442
from 41443
his 41444
mother.” 41445
 41446
Machua 41447
Appa 41448
pointed 41449
at 41450
Little 41451
Toomai, 41452
and 41453
Petersen 41454
Sahib 41455
looked, 41456
and 41457
Little 41458
Toomai 41459
bowed 41460
to 41461
the 41462
earth. 41463
 41464
“He 41465
throw 41466
a 41467
rope? 41468
He 41469
is 41470
smaller 41471
than 41472
a 41473
picket-pin. 41474
Little 41475
one, 41476
what 41477
is 41478
thy 41479
name?” 41480
said 41481
Petersen 41482
Sahib. 41483
 41484
Little 41485
Toomai 41486
was 41487
too 41488
frightened 41489
to 41490
speak, 41491
but 41492
Kala 41493
Nag 41494
was 41495
behind 41496
him, 41497
and 41498
Toomai 41499
made 41500
a 41501
sign 41502
with 41503
his 41504
hand, 41505
and 41506
the 41507
elephant 41508
caught 41509
him 41510
up 41511
in 41512
his 41513
trunk 41514
and 41515
held 41516
him 41517
level 41518
with 41519
Pudmini’s 41520
forehead, 41521
in 41522
front 41523
of 41524
the 41525
great 41526
Petersen 41527
Sahib. 41528
Then 41529
Little 41530
Toomai 41531
covered 41532
his 41533
face 41534
with 41535
his 41536
hands, 41537
for 41538
he 41539
was 41540
only 41541
a 41542
child, 41543
and 41544
except 41545
where 41546
elephants 41547
were 41548
concerned, 41549
he 41550
was 41551
just 41552
as 41553
bashful 41554
as 41555
a 41556
child 41557
could 41558
be. 41559
 41560
“Oho!” 41561
said 41562
Petersen 41563
Sahib, 41564
smiling 41565
underneath 41566
his 41567
mustache, 41568
“and 41569
why 41570
didst 41571
thou 41572
teach 41573
thy 41574
elephant 41575
that 41576
trick? 41577
Was 41578
it 41579
to 41580
help 41581
thee 41582
steal 41583
green 41584
corn 41585
from 41586
the 41587
roofs 41588
of 41589
the 41590
houses 41591
when 41592
the 41593
ears 41594
are 41595
put 41596
out 41597
to 41598
dry?” 41599
 41600
“Not 41601
green 41602
corn, 41603
Protector 41604
of 41605
the 41606
Poor,--melons,” 41607
said 41608
Little 41609
Toomai, 41610
and 41611
all 41612
the 41613
men 41614
sitting 41615
about 41616
broke 41617
into 41618
a 41619
roar 41620
of 41621
laughter. 41622
Most 41623
of 41624
them 41625
had 41626
taught 41627
their 41628
elephants 41629
that 41630
trick 41631
when 41632
they 41633
were 41634
boys. 41635
Little 41636
Toomai 41637
was 41638
hanging 41639
eight 41640
feet 41641
up 41642
in 41643
the 41644
air, 41645
and 41646
he 41647
wished 41648
very 41649
much 41650
that 41651
he 41652
were 41653
eight 41654
feet 41655
underground. 41656
 41657
“He 41658
is 41659
Toomai, 41660
my 41661
son, 41662
Sahib,” 41663
said 41664
Big 41665
Toomai, 41666
scowling. 41667
“He 41668
is 41669
a 41670
very 41671
bad 41672
boy, 41673
and 41674
he 41675
will 41676
end 41677
in 41678
a 41679
jail, 41680
Sahib.” 41681
 41682
“Of 41683
that 41684
I 41685
have 41686
my 41687
doubts,” 41688
said 41689
Petersen 41690
Sahib. 41691
“A 41692
boy 41693
who 41694
can 41695
face 41696
a 41697
full 41698
Keddah 41699
at 41700
his 41701
age 41702
does 41703
not 41704
end 41705
in 41706
jails. 41707
See, 41708
little 41709
one, 41710
here 41711
are 41712
four 41713
annas 41714
to 41715
spend 41716
in 41717
sweetmeats 41718
because 41719
thou 41720
hast 41721
a 41722
little 41723
head 41724
under 41725
that 41726
great 41727
thatch 41728
of 41729
hair. 41730
In 41731
time 41732
thou 41733
mayest 41734
become 41735
a 41736
hunter 41737
too.” 41738
Big 41739
Toomai 41740
scowled 41741
more 41742
than 41743
ever. 41744
“Remember, 41745
though, 41746
that 41747
Keddahs 41748
are 41749
not 41750
good 41751
for 41752
children 41753
to 41754
play 41755
in,” 41756
Petersen 41757
Sahib 41758
went 41759
on. 41760
 41761
“Must 41762
I 41763
never 41764
go 41765
there, 41766
Sahib?” 41767
asked 41768
Little 41769
Toomai 41770
with 41771
a 41772
big 41773
gasp. 41774
 41775
“Yes.” 41776
Petersen 41777
Sahib 41778
smiled 41779
again. 41780
“When 41781
thou 41782
hast 41783
seen 41784
the 41785
elephants 41786
dance. 41787
That 41788
is 41789
the 41790
proper 41791
time. 41792
Come 41793
to 41794
me 41795
when 41796
thou 41797
hast 41798
seen 41799
the 41800
elephants 41801
dance, 41802
and 41803
then 41804
I 41805
will 41806
let 41807
thee 41808
go 41809
into 41810
all 41811
the 41812
Keddahs.” 41813
 41814
There 41815
was 41816
another 41817
roar 41818
of 41819
laughter, 41820
for 41821
that 41822
is 41823
an 41824
old 41825
joke 41826
among 41827
elephant-catchers, 41828
and 41829
it 41830
means 41831
just 41832
never. 41833
There 41834
are 41835
great 41836
cleared 41837
flat 41838
places 41839
hidden 41840
away 41841
in 41842
the 41843
forests 41844
that 41845
are 41846
called 41847
elephants’ 41848
ball-rooms, 41849
but 41850
even 41851
these 41852
are 41853
only 41854
found 41855
by 41856
accident, 41857
and 41858
no 41859
man 41860
has 41861
ever 41862
seen 41863
the 41864
elephants 41865
dance. 41866
When 41867
a 41868
driver 41869
boasts 41870
of 41871
his 41872
skill 41873
and 41874
bravery 41875
the 41876
other 41877
drivers 41878
say, 41879
“And 41880
when 41881
didst 41882
thou 41883
see 41884
the 41885
elephants 41886
dance?” 41887
 41888
Kala 41889
Nag 41890
put 41891
Little 41892
Toomai 41893
down, 41894
and 41895
he 41896
bowed 41897
to 41898
the 41899
earth 41900
again 41901
and 41902
went 41903
away 41904
with 41905
his 41906
father, 41907
and 41908
gave 41909
the 41910
silver 41911
four-anna 41912
piece 41913
to 41914
his 41915
mother, 41916
who 41917
was 41918
nursing 41919
his 41920
baby 41921
brother, 41922
and 41923
they 41924
all 41925
were 41926
put 41927
up 41928
on 41929
Kala 41930
Nag’s 41931
back, 41932
and 41933
the 41934
line 41935
of 41936
grunting, 41937
squealing 41938
elephants 41939
rolled 41940
down 41941
the 41942
hill 41943
path 41944
to 41945
the 41946
plains. 41947
It 41948
was 41949
a 41950
very 41951
lively 41952
march 41953
on 41954
account 41955
of 41956
the 41957
new 41958
elephants, 41959
who 41960
gave 41961
trouble 41962
at 41963
every 41964
ford, 41965
and 41966
needed 41967
coaxing 41968
or 41969
beating 41970
every 41971
other 41972
minute. 41973
 41974
Big 41975
Toomai 41976
prodded 41977
Kala 41978
Nag 41979
spitefully, 41980
for 41981
he 41982
was 41983
very 41984
angry, 41985
but 41986
Little 41987
Toomai 41988
was 41989
too 41990
happy 41991
to 41992
speak. 41993
Petersen 41994
Sahib 41995
had 41996
noticed 41997
him, 41998
and 41999
given 42000
him 42001
money, 42002
so 42003
he 42004
felt 42005
as 42006
a 42007
private 42008
soldier 42009
would 42010
feel 42011
if 42012
he 42013
had 42014
been 42015
called 42016
out 42017
of 42018
the 42019
ranks 42020
and 42021
praised 42022
by 42023
his 42024
commander-in-chief. 42025
 42026
“What 42027
did 42028
Petersen 42029
Sahib 42030
mean 42031
by 42032
the 42033
elephant 42034
dance?” 42035
he 42036
said, 42037
at 42038
last, 42039
softly 42040
to 42041
his 42042
mother. 42043
 42044
Big 42045
Toomai 42046
heard 42047
him 42048
and 42049
grunted. 42050
“That 42051
thou 42052
shouldst 42053
never 42054
be 42055
one 42056
of 42057
these 42058
hill 42059
buffaloes 42060
of 42061
trackers. 42062
That 42063
was 42064
what 42065
he 42066
meant. 42067
Oh, 42068
you 42069
in 42070
front, 42071
what 42072
is 42073
blocking 42074
the 42075
way?” 42076
 42077
An 42078
Assamese 42079
driver, 42080
two 42081
or 42082
three 42083
elephants 42084
ahead, 42085
turned 42086
round 42087
angrily, 42088
crying: 42089
“Bring 42090
up 42091
Kala 42092
Nag, 42093
and 42094
knock 42095
this 42096
youngster 42097
of 42098
mine 42099
into 42100
good 42101
behavior. 42102
Why 42103
should 42104
Petersen 42105
Sahib 42106
have 42107
chosen 42108
me 42109
to 42110
go 42111
down 42112
with 42113
you 42114
donkeys 42115
of 42116
the 42117
rice 42118
fields? 42119
Lay 42120
your 42121
beast 42122
alongside, 42123
Toomai, 42124
and 42125
let 42126
him 42127
prod 42128
with 42129
his 42130
tusks. 42131
By 42132
all 42133
the 42134
Gods 42135
of 42136
the 42137
Hills, 42138
these 42139
new 42140
elephants 42141
are 42142
possessed, 42143
or 42144
else 42145
they 42146
can 42147
smell 42148
their 42149
companions 42150
in 42151
the 42152
jungle.” 42153
Kala 42154
Nag 42155
hit 42156
the 42157
new 42158
elephant 42159
in 42160
the 42161
ribs 42162
and 42163
knocked 42164
the 42165
wind 42166
out 42167
of 42168
him, 42169
as 42170
Big 42171
Toomai 42172
said, 42173
“We 42174
have 42175
swept 42176
the 42177
hills 42178
of 42179
wild 42180
elephants 42181
at 42182
the 42183
last 42184
catch. 42185
It 42186
is 42187
only 42188
your 42189
carelessness 42190
in 42191
driving. 42192
Must 42193
I 42194
keep 42195
order 42196
along 42197
the 42198
whole 42199
line?” 42200
 42201
“Hear 42202
him!” 42203
said 42204
the 42205
other 42206
driver. 42207
“We 42208
have 42209
swept 42210
the 42211
hills! 42212
Ho! 42213
Ho! 42214
You 42215
are 42216
very 42217
wise, 42218
you 42219
plains 42220
people. 42221
Anyone 42222
but 42223
a 42224
mud-head 42225
who 42226
never 42227
saw 42228
the 42229
jungle 42230
would 42231
know 42232
that 42233
they 42234
know 42235
that 42236
the 42237
drives 42238
are 42239
ended 42240
for 42241
the 42242
season. 42243
Therefore 42244
all 42245
the 42246
wild 42247
elephants 42248
to-night 42249
will--but 42250
why 42251
should 42252
I 42253
waste 42254
wisdom 42255
on 42256
a 42257
river-turtle?” 42258
 42259
“What 42260
will 42261
they 42262
do?” 42263
Little 42264
Toomai 42265
called 42266
out. 42267
 42268
“Ohe, 42269
little 42270
one. 42271
Art 42272
thou 42273
there? 42274
Well, 42275
I 42276
will 42277
tell 42278
thee, 42279
for 42280
thou 42281
hast 42282
a 42283
cool 42284
head. 42285
They 42286
will 42287
dance, 42288
and 42289
it 42290
behooves 42291
thy 42292
father, 42293
who 42294
has 42295
swept 42296
all 42297
the 42298
hills 42299
of 42300
all 42301
the 42302
elephants, 42303
to 42304
double-chain 42305
his 42306
pickets 42307
to-night.” 42308
 42309
“What 42310
talk 42311
is 42312
this?” 42313
said 42314
Big 42315
Toomai. 42316
“For 42317
forty 42318
years, 42319
father 42320
and 42321
son, 42322
we 42323
have 42324
tended 42325
elephants, 42326
and 42327
we 42328
have 42329
never 42330
heard 42331
such 42332
moonshine 42333
about 42334
dances.” 42335
 42336
“Yes; 42337
but 42338
a 42339
plainsman 42340
who 42341
lives 42342
in 42343
a 42344
hut 42345
knows 42346
only 42347
the 42348
four 42349
walls 42350
of 42351
his 42352
hut. 42353
Well, 42354
leave 42355
thy 42356
elephants 42357
unshackled 42358
tonight 42359
and 42360
see 42361
what 42362
comes. 42363
As 42364
for 42365
their 42366
dancing, 42367
I 42368
have 42369
seen 42370
the 42371
place 42372
where--Bapree-bap! 42373
How 42374
many 42375
windings 42376
has 42377
the 42378
Dihang 42379
River? 42380
Here 42381
is 42382
another 42383
ford, 42384
and 42385
we 42386
must 42387
swim 42388
the 42389
calves. 42390
Stop 42391
still, 42392
you 42393
behind 42394
there.” 42395
 42396
And 42397
in 42398
this 42399
way, 42400
talking 42401
and 42402
wrangling 42403
and 42404
splashing 42405
through 42406
the 42407
rivers, 42408
they 42409
made 42410
their 42411
first 42412
march 42413
to 42414
a 42415
sort 42416
of 42417
receiving 42418
camp 42419
for 42420
the 42421
new 42422
elephants. 42423
But 42424
they 42425
lost 42426
their 42427
tempers 42428
long 42429
before 42430
they 42431
got 42432
there. 42433
 42434
Then 42435
the 42436
elephants 42437
were 42438
chained 42439
by 42440
their 42441
hind 42442
legs 42443
to 42444
their 42445
big 42446
stumps 42447
of 42448
pickets, 42449
and 42450
extra 42451
ropes 42452
were 42453
fitted 42454
to 42455
the 42456
new 42457
elephants, 42458
and 42459
the 42460
fodder 42461
was 42462
piled 42463
before 42464
them, 42465
and 42466
the 42467
hill 42468
drivers 42469
went 42470
back 42471
to 42472
Petersen 42473
Sahib 42474
through 42475
the 42476
afternoon 42477
light, 42478
telling 42479
the 42480
plains 42481
drivers 42482
to 42483
be 42484
extra 42485
careful 42486
that 42487
night, 42488
and 42489
laughing 42490
when 42491
the 42492
plains 42493
drivers 42494
asked 42495
the 42496
reason. 42497
 42498
Little 42499
Toomai 42500
attended 42501
to 42502
Kala 42503
Nag’s 42504
supper, 42505
and 42506
as 42507
evening 42508
fell, 42509
wandered 42510
through 42511
the 42512
camp, 42513
unspeakably 42514
happy, 42515
in 42516
search 42517
of 42518
a 42519
tom-tom. 42520
When 42521
an 42522
Indian 42523
child’s 42524
heart 42525
is 42526
full, 42527
he 42528
does 42529
not 42530
run 42531
about 42532
and 42533
make 42534
a 42535
noise 42536
in 42537
an 42538
irregular 42539
fashion. 42540
He 42541
sits 42542
down 42543
to 42544
a 42545
sort 42546
of 42547
revel 42548
all 42549
by 42550
himself. 42551
And 42552
Little 42553
Toomai 42554
had 42555
been 42556
spoken 42557
to 42558
by 42559
Petersen 42560
Sahib! 42561
If 42562
he 42563
had 42564
not 42565
found 42566
what 42567
he 42568
wanted, 42569
I 42570
believe 42571
he 42572
would 42573
have 42574
been 42575
ill. 42576
But 42577
the 42578
sweetmeat 42579
seller 42580
in 42581
the 42582
camp 42583
lent 42584
him 42585
a 42586
little 42587
tom-tom--a 42588
drum 42589
beaten 42590
with 42591
the 42592
flat 42593
of 42594
the 42595
hand--and 42596
he 42597
sat 42598
down, 42599
cross-legged, 42600
before 42601
Kala 42602
Nag 42603
as 42604
the 42605
stars 42606
began 42607
to 42608
come 42609
out, 42610
the 42611
tom-tom 42612
in 42613
his 42614
lap, 42615
and 42616
he 42617
thumped 42618
and 42619
he 42620
thumped 42621
and 42622
he 42623
thumped, 42624
and 42625
the 42626
more 42627
he 42628
thought 42629
of 42630
the 42631
great 42632
honor 42633
that 42634
had 42635
been 42636
done 42637
to 42638
him, 42639
the 42640
more 42641
he 42642
thumped, 42643
all 42644
alone 42645
among 42646
the 42647
elephant 42648
fodder. 42649
There 42650
was 42651
no 42652
tune 42653
and 42654
no 42655
words, 42656
but 42657
the 42658
thumping 42659
made 42660
him 42661
happy. 42662
 42663
The 42664
new 42665
elephants 42666
strained 42667
at 42668
their 42669
ropes, 42670
and 42671
squealed 42672
and 42673
trumpeted 42674
from 42675
time 42676
to 42677
time, 42678
and 42679
he 42680
could 42681
hear 42682
his 42683
mother 42684
in 42685
the 42686
camp 42687
hut 42688
putting 42689
his 42690
small 42691
brother 42692
to 42693
sleep 42694
with 42695
an 42696
old, 42697
old 42698
song 42699
about 42700
the 42701
great 42702
God 42703
Shiv, 42704
who 42705
once 42706
told 42707
all 42708
the 42709
animals 42710
what 42711
they 42712
should 42713
eat. 42714
It 42715
is 42716
a 42717
very 42718
soothing 42719
lullaby, 42720
and 42721
the 42722
first 42723
verse 42724
says: 42725
 42726
 42727
 42728
 42729
 42730
 42731
Shiv, 42732
who 42733
poured 42734
the 42735
harvest 42736
and 42737
made 42738
the 42739
winds 42740
to 42741
blow, 42742
 42743
 42744
 42745
 42746
 42747
Sitting 42748
at 42749
the 42750
doorways 42751
of 42752
a 42753
day 42754
of 42755
long 42756
ago, 42757
 42758
 42759
 42760
 42761
 42762
Gave 42763
to 42764
each 42765
his 42766
portion, 42767
food 42768
and 42769
toil 42770
and 42771
fate, 42772
 42773
 42774
 42775
 42776
 42777
From 42778
the 42779
King 42780
upon 42781
the 42782
_guddee_ 42783
to 42784
the 42785
Beggar 42786
at 42787
the 42788
gate. 42789
 42790
 42791
 42792
 42793
 42794
 42795
 42796
 42797
All 42798
things 42799
made 42800
he--Shiva 42801
the 42802
Preserver. 42803
 42804
 42805
 42806
 42807
 42808
Mahadeo! 42809
 42810
Mahadeo! 42811
 42812
He 42813
made 42814
all-- 42815
 42816
 42817
 42818
 42819
 42820
Thorn 42821
for 42822
the 42823
camel, 42824
fodder 42825
for 42826
the 42827
kine, 42828
 42829
 42830
 42831
 42832
 42833
And 42834
mother’s 42835
heart 42836
for 42837
sleepy 42838
head, 42839
O 42840
little 42841
son 42842
of 42843
mine! 42844
 42845
Little 42846
Toomai 42847
came 42848
in 42849
with 42850
a 42851
joyous 42852
tunk-a-tunk 42853
at 42854
the 42855
end 42856
of 42857
each 42858
verse, 42859
till 42860
he 42861
felt 42862
sleepy 42863
and 42864
stretched 42865
himself 42866
on 42867
the 42868
fodder 42869
at 42870
Kala 42871
Nag’s 42872
side. 42873
At 42874
last 42875
the 42876
elephants 42877
began 42878
to 42879
lie 42880
down 42881
one 42882
after 42883
another 42884
as 42885
is 42886
their 42887
custom, 42888
till 42889
only 42890
Kala 42891
Nag 42892
at 42893
the 42894
right 42895
of 42896
the 42897
line 42898
was 42899
left 42900
standing 42901
up; 42902
and 42903
he 42904
rocked 42905
slowly 42906
from 42907
side 42908
to 42909
side, 42910
his 42911
ears 42912
put 42913
forward 42914
to 42915
listen 42916
to 42917
the 42918
night 42919
wind 42920
as 42921
it 42922
blew 42923
very 42924
slowly 42925
across 42926
the 42927
hills. 42928
The 42929
air 42930
was 42931
full 42932
of 42933
all 42934
the 42935
night 42936
noises 42937
that, 42938
taken 42939
together, 42940
make 42941
one 42942
big 42943
silence--the 42944
click 42945
of 42946
one 42947
bamboo 42948
stem 42949
against 42950
the 42951
other, 42952
the 42953
rustle 42954
of 42955
something 42956
alive 42957
in 42958
the 42959
undergrowth, 42960
the 42961
scratch 42962
and 42963
squawk 42964
of 42965
a 42966
half-waked 42967
bird 42968
(birds 42969
are 42970
awake 42971
in 42972
the 42973
night 42974
much 42975
more 42976
often 42977
than 42978
we 42979
imagine), 42980
and 42981
the 42982
fall 42983
of 42984
water 42985
ever 42986
so 42987
far 42988
away. 42989
Little 42990
Toomai 42991
slept 42992
for 42993
some 42994
time, 42995
and 42996
when 42997
he 42998
waked 42999
it 43000
was 43001
brilliant 43002
moonlight, 43003
and 43004
Kala 43005
Nag 43006
was 43007
still 43008
standing 43009
up 43010
with 43011
his 43012
ears 43013
cocked. 43014
Little 43015
Toomai 43016
turned, 43017
rustling 43018
in 43019
the 43020
fodder, 43021
and 43022
watched 43023
the 43024
curve 43025
of 43026
his 43027
big 43028
back 43029
against 43030
half 43031
the 43032
stars 43033
in 43034
heaven, 43035
and 43036
while 43037
he 43038
watched 43039
he 43040
heard, 43041
so 43042
far 43043
away 43044
that 43045
it 43046
sounded 43047
no 43048
more 43049
than 43050
a 43051
pinhole 43052
of 43053
noise 43054
pricked 43055
through 43056
the 43057
stillness, 43058
the 43059
“hoot-toot” 43060
of 43061
a 43062
wild 43063
elephant. 43064
 43065
All 43066
the 43067
elephants 43068
in 43069
the 43070
lines 43071
jumped 43072
up 43073
as 43074
if 43075
they 43076
had 43077
been 43078
shot, 43079
and 43080
their 43081
grunts 43082
at 43083
last 43084
waked 43085
the 43086
sleeping 43087
mahouts, 43088
and 43089
they 43090
came 43091
out 43092
and 43093
drove 43094
in 43095
the 43096
picket 43097
pegs 43098
with 43099
big 43100
mallets, 43101
and 43102
tightened 43103
this 43104
rope 43105
and 43106
knotted 43107
that 43108
till 43109
all 43110
was 43111
quiet. 43112
One 43113
new 43114
elephant 43115
had 43116
nearly 43117
grubbed 43118
up 43119
his 43120
picket, 43121
and 43122
Big 43123
Toomai 43124
took 43125
off 43126
Kala 43127
Nag’s 43128
leg 43129
chain 43130
and 43131
shackled 43132
that 43133
elephant 43134
fore-foot 43135
to 43136
hind-foot, 43137
but 43138
slipped 43139
a 43140
loop 43141
of 43142
grass 43143
string 43144
round 43145
Kala 43146
Nag’s 43147
leg, 43148
and 43149
told 43150
him 43151
to 43152
remember 43153
that 43154
he 43155
was 43156
tied 43157
fast. 43158
He 43159
knew 43160
that 43161
he 43162
and 43163
his 43164
father 43165
and 43166
his 43167
grandfather 43168
had 43169
done 43170
the 43171
very 43172
same 43173
thing 43174
hundreds 43175
of 43176
times 43177
before. 43178
Kala 43179
Nag 43180
did 43181
not 43182
answer 43183
to 43184
the 43185
order 43186
by 43187
gurgling, 43188
as 43189
he 43190
usually 43191
did. 43192
He 43193
stood 43194
still, 43195
looking 43196
out 43197
across 43198
the 43199
moonlight, 43200
his 43201
head 43202
a 43203
little 43204
raised 43205
and 43206
his 43207
ears 43208
spread 43209
like 43210
fans, 43211
up 43212
to 43213
the 43214
great 43215
folds 43216
of 43217
the 43218
Garo 43219
hills. 43220
 43221
“Tend 43222
to 43223
him 43224
if 43225
he 43226
grows 43227
restless 43228
in 43229
the 43230
night,” 43231
said 43232
Big 43233
Toomai 43234
to 43235
Little 43236
Toomai, 43237
and 43238
he 43239
went 43240
into 43241
the 43242
hut 43243
and 43244
slept. 43245
Little 43246
Toomai 43247
was 43248
just 43249
going 43250
to 43251
sleep, 43252
too, 43253
when 43254
he 43255
heard 43256
the 43257
coir 43258
string 43259
snap 43260
with 43261
a 43262
little 43263
“tang,” 43264
and 43265
Kala 43266
Nag 43267
rolled 43268
out 43269
of 43270
his 43271
pickets 43272
as 43273
slowly 43274
and 43275
as 43276
silently 43277
as 43278
a 43279
cloud 43280
rolls 43281
out 43282
of 43283
the 43284
mouth 43285
of 43286
a 43287
valley. 43288
Little 43289
Toomai 43290
pattered 43291
after 43292
him, 43293
barefooted, 43294
down 43295
the 43296
road 43297
in 43298
the 43299
moonlight, 43300
calling 43301
under 43302
his 43303
breath, 43304
“Kala 43305
Nag! 43306
Kala 43307
Nag! 43308
Take 43309
me 43310
with 43311
you, 43312
O 43313
Kala 43314
Nag!” 43315
 43316
The 43317
elephant 43318
turned, 43319
without 43320
a 43321
sound, 43322
took 43323
three 43324
strides 43325
back 43326
to 43327
the 43328
boy 43329
in 43330
the 43331
moonlight, 43332
put 43333
down 43334
his 43335
trunk, 43336
swung 43337
him 43338
up 43339
to 43340
his 43341
neck, 43342
and 43343
almost 43344
before 43345
Little 43346
Toomai 43347
had 43348
settled 43349
his 43350
knees, 43351
slipped 43352
into 43353
the 43354
forest. 43355
 43356
There 43357
was 43358
one 43359
blast 43360
of 43361
furious 43362
trumpeting 43363
from 43364
the 43365
lines, 43366
and 43367
then 43368
the 43369
silence 43370
shut 43371
down 43372
on 43373
everything, 43374
and 43375
Kala 43376
Nag 43377
began 43378
to 43379
move. 43380
Sometimes 43381
a 43382
tuft 43383
of 43384
high 43385
grass 43386
washed 43387
along 43388
his 43389
sides 43390
as 43391
a 43392
wave 43393
washes 43394
along 43395
the 43396
sides 43397
of 43398
a 43399
ship, 43400
and 43401
sometimes 43402
a 43403
cluster 43404
of 43405
wild-pepper 43406
vines 43407
would 43408
scrape 43409
along 43410
his 43411
back, 43412
or 43413
a 43414
bamboo 43415
would 43416
creak 43417
where 43418
his 43419
shoulder 43420
touched 43421
it. 43422
But 43423
between 43424
those 43425
times 43426
he 43427
moved 43428
absolutely 43429
without 43430
any 43431
sound, 43432
drifting 43433
through 43434
the 43435
thick 43436
Garo 43437
forest 43438
as 43439
though 43440
it 43441
had 43442
been 43443
smoke. 43444
He 43445
was 43446
going 43447
uphill, 43448
but 43449
though 43450
Little 43451
Toomai 43452
watched 43453
the 43454
stars 43455
in 43456
the 43457
rifts 43458
of 43459
the 43460
trees, 43461
he 43462
could 43463
not 43464
tell 43465
in 43466
what 43467
direction. 43468
 43469
Then 43470
Kala 43471
Nag 43472
reached 43473
the 43474
crest 43475
of 43476
the 43477
ascent 43478
and 43479
stopped 43480
for 43481
a 43482
minute, 43483
and 43484
Little 43485
Toomai 43486
could 43487
see 43488
the 43489
tops 43490
of 43491
the 43492
trees 43493
lying 43494
all 43495
speckled 43496
and 43497
furry 43498
under 43499
the 43500
moonlight 43501
for 43502
miles 43503
and 43504
miles, 43505
and 43506
the 43507
blue-white 43508
mist 43509
over 43510
the 43511
river 43512
in 43513
the 43514
hollow. 43515
Toomai 43516
leaned 43517
forward 43518
and 43519
looked, 43520
and 43521
he 43522
felt 43523
that 43524
the 43525
forest 43526
was 43527
awake 43528
below 43529
him--awake 43530
and 43531
alive 43532
and 43533
crowded. 43534
A 43535
big 43536
brown 43537
fruit-eating 43538
bat 43539
brushed 43540
past 43541
his 43542
ear; 43543
a 43544
porcupine’s 43545
quills 43546
rattled 43547
in 43548
the 43549
thicket; 43550
and 43551
in 43552
the 43553
darkness 43554
between 43555
the 43556
tree 43557
stems 43558
he 43559
heard 43560
a 43561
hog-bear 43562
digging 43563
hard 43564
in 43565
the 43566
moist 43567
warm 43568
earth, 43569
and 43570
snuffing 43571
as 43572
it 43573
digged. 43574
 43575
Then 43576
the 43577
branches 43578
closed 43579
over 43580
his 43581
head 43582
again, 43583
and 43584
Kala 43585
Nag 43586
began 43587
to 43588
go 43589
down 43590
into 43591
the 43592
valley--not 43593
quietly 43594
this 43595
time, 43596
but 43597
as 43598
a 43599
runaway 43600
gun 43601
goes 43602
down 43603
a 43604
steep 43605
bank--in 43606
one 43607
rush. 43608
The 43609
huge 43610
limbs 43611
moved 43612
as 43613
steadily 43614
as 43615
pistons, 43616
eight 43617
feet 43618
to 43619
each 43620
stride, 43621
and 43622
the 43623
wrinkled 43624
skin 43625
of 43626
the 43627
elbow 43628
points 43629
rustled. 43630
The 43631
undergrowth 43632
on 43633
either 43634
side 43635
of 43636
him 43637
ripped 43638
with 43639
a 43640
noise 43641
like 43642
torn 43643
canvas, 43644
and 43645
the 43646
saplings 43647
that 43648
he 43649
heaved 43650
away 43651
right 43652
and 43653
left 43654
with 43655
his 43656
shoulders 43657
sprang 43658
back 43659
again 43660
and 43661
banged 43662
him 43663
on 43664
the 43665
flank, 43666
and 43667
great 43668
trails 43669
of 43670
creepers, 43671
all 43672
matted 43673
together, 43674
hung 43675
from 43676
his 43677
tusks 43678
as 43679
he 43680
threw 43681
his 43682
head 43683
from 43684
side 43685
to 43686
side 43687
and 43688
plowed 43689
out 43690
his 43691
pathway. 43692
Then 43693
Little 43694
Toomai 43695
laid 43696
himself 43697
down 43698
close 43699
to 43700
the 43701
great 43702
neck 43703
lest 43704
a 43705
swinging 43706
bough 43707
should 43708
sweep 43709
him 43710
to 43711
the 43712
ground, 43713
and 43714
he 43715
wished 43716
that 43717
he 43718
were 43719
back 43720
in 43721
the 43722
lines 43723
again. 43724
 43725
The 43726
grass 43727
began 43728
to 43729
get 43730
squashy, 43731
and 43732
Kala 43733
Nag’s 43734
feet 43735
sucked 43736
and 43737
squelched 43738
as 43739
he 43740
put 43741
them 43742
down, 43743
and 43744
the 43745
night 43746
mist 43747
at 43748
the 43749
bottom 43750
of 43751
the 43752
valley 43753
chilled 43754
Little 43755
Toomai. 43756
There 43757
was 43758
a 43759
splash 43760
and 43761
a 43762
trample, 43763
and 43764
the 43765
rush 43766
of 43767
running 43768
water, 43769
and 43770
Kala 43771
Nag 43772
strode 43773
through 43774
the 43775
bed 43776
of 43777
a 43778
river, 43779
feeling 43780
his 43781
way 43782
at 43783
each 43784
step. 43785
Above 43786
the 43787
noise 43788
of 43789
the 43790
water, 43791
as 43792
it 43793
swirled 43794
round 43795
the 43796
elephant’s 43797
legs, 43798
Little 43799
Toomai 43800
could 43801
hear 43802
more 43803
splashing 43804
and 43805
some 43806
trumpeting 43807
both 43808
upstream 43809
and 43810
down--great 43811
grunts 43812
and 43813
angry 43814
snortings, 43815
and 43816
all 43817
the 43818
mist 43819
about 43820
him 43821
seemed 43822
to 43823
be 43824
full 43825
of 43826
rolling, 43827
wavy 43828
shadows. 43829
 43830
“Ai!” 43831
he 43832
said, 43833
half 43834
aloud, 43835
his 43836
teeth 43837
chattering. 43838
“The 43839
elephant-folk 43840
are 43841
out 43842
tonight. 43843
It 43844
is 43845
the 43846
dance, 43847
then!” 43848
 43849
Kala 43850
Nag 43851
swashed 43852
out 43853
of 43854
the 43855
water, 43856
blew 43857
his 43858
trunk 43859
clear, 43860
and 43861
began 43862
another 43863
climb. 43864
But 43865
this 43866
time 43867
he 43868
was 43869
not 43870
alone, 43871
and 43872
he 43873
had 43874
not 43875
to 43876
make 43877
his 43878
path. 43879
That 43880
was 43881
made 43882
already, 43883
six 43884
feet 43885
wide, 43886
in 43887
front 43888
of 43889
him, 43890
where 43891
the 43892
bent 43893
jungle-grass 43894
was 43895
trying 43896
to 43897
recover 43898
itself 43899
and 43900
stand 43901
up. 43902
Many 43903
elephants 43904
must 43905
have 43906
gone 43907
that 43908
way 43909
only 43910
a 43911
few 43912
minutes 43913
before. 43914
Little 43915
Toomai 43916
looked 43917
back, 43918
and 43919
behind 43920
him 43921
a 43922
great 43923
wild 43924
tusker 43925
with 43926
his 43927
little 43928
pig’s 43929
eyes 43930
glowing 43931
like 43932
hot 43933
coals 43934
was 43935
just 43936
lifting 43937
himself 43938
out 43939
of 43940
the 43941
misty 43942
river. 43943
Then 43944
the 43945
trees 43946
closed 43947
up 43948
again, 43949
and 43950
they 43951
went 43952
on 43953
and 43954
up, 43955
with 43956
trumpetings 43957
and 43958
crashings, 43959
and 43960
the 43961
sound 43962
of 43963
breaking 43964
branches 43965
on 43966
every 43967
side 43968
of 43969
them. 43970
 43971
At 43972
last 43973
Kala 43974
Nag 43975
stood 43976
still 43977
between 43978
two 43979
tree-trunks 43980
at 43981
the 43982
very 43983
top 43984
of 43985
the 43986
hill. 43987
They 43988
were 43989
part 43990
of 43991
a 43992
circle 43993
of 43994
trees 43995
that 43996
grew 43997
round 43998
an 43999
irregular 44000
space 44001
of 44002
some 44003
three 44004
or 44005
four 44006
acres, 44007
and 44008
in 44009
all 44010
that 44011
space, 44012
as 44013
Little 44014
Toomai 44015
could 44016
see, 44017
the 44018
ground 44019
had 44020
been 44021
trampled 44022
down 44023
as 44024
hard 44025
as 44026
a 44027
brick 44028
floor. 44029
Some 44030
trees 44031
grew 44032
in 44033
the 44034
center 44035
of 44036
the 44037
clearing, 44038
but 44039
their 44040
bark 44041
was 44042
rubbed 44043
away, 44044
and 44045
the 44046
white 44047
wood 44048
beneath 44049
showed 44050
all 44051
shiny 44052
and 44053
polished 44054
in 44055
the 44056
patches 44057
of 44058
moonlight. 44059
There 44060
were 44061
creepers 44062
hanging 44063
from 44064
the 44065
upper 44066
branches, 44067
and 44068
the 44069
bells 44070
of 44071
the 44072
flowers 44073
of 44074
the 44075
creepers, 44076
great 44077
waxy 44078
white 44079
things 44080
like 44081
convolvuluses, 44082
hung 44083
down 44084
fast 44085
asleep. 44086
But 44087
within 44088
the 44089
limits 44090
of 44091
the 44092
clearing 44093
there 44094
was 44095
not 44096
a 44097
single 44098
blade 44099
of 44100
green--nothing 44101
but 44102
the 44103
trampled 44104
earth. 44105
 44106
The 44107
moonlight 44108
showed 44109
it 44110
all 44111
iron 44112
gray, 44113
except 44114
where 44115
some 44116
elephants 44117
stood 44118
upon 44119
it, 44120
and 44121
their 44122
shadows 44123
were 44124
inky 44125
black. 44126
Little 44127
Toomai 44128
looked, 44129
holding 44130
his 44131
breath, 44132
with 44133
his 44134
eyes 44135
starting 44136
out 44137
of 44138
his 44139
head, 44140
and 44141
as 44142
he 44143
looked, 44144
more 44145
and 44146
more 44147
and 44148
more 44149
elephants 44150
swung 44151
out 44152
into 44153
the 44154
open 44155
from 44156
between 44157
the 44158
tree 44159
trunks. 44160
Little 44161
Toomai 44162
could 44163
only 44164
count 44165
up 44166
to 44167
ten, 44168
and 44169
he 44170
counted 44171
again 44172
and 44173
again 44174
on 44175
his 44176
fingers 44177
till 44178
he 44179
lost 44180
count 44181
of 44182
the 44183
tens, 44184
and 44185
his 44186
head 44187
began 44188
to 44189
swim. 44190
Outside 44191
the 44192
clearing 44193
he 44194
could 44195
hear 44196
them 44197
crashing 44198
in 44199
the 44200
undergrowth 44201
as 44202
they 44203
worked 44204
their 44205
way 44206
up 44207
the 44208
hillside, 44209
but 44210
as 44211
soon 44212
as 44213
they 44214
were 44215
within 44216
the 44217
circle 44218
of 44219
the 44220
tree 44221
trunks 44222
they 44223
moved 44224
like 44225
ghosts. 44226
 44227
There 44228
were 44229
white-tusked 44230
wild 44231
males, 44232
with 44233
fallen 44234
leaves 44235
and 44236
nuts 44237
and 44238
twigs 44239
lying 44240
in 44241
the 44242
wrinkles 44243
of 44244
their 44245
necks 44246
and 44247
the 44248
folds 44249
of 44250
their 44251
ears; 44252
fat, 44253
slow-footed 44254
she-elephants, 44255
with 44256
restless, 44257
little 44258
pinky 44259
black 44260
calves 44261
only 44262
three 44263
or 44264
four 44265
feet 44266
high 44267
running 44268
under 44269
their 44270
stomachs; 44271
young 44272
elephants 44273
with 44274
their 44275
tusks 44276
just 44277
beginning 44278
to 44279
show, 44280
and 44281
very 44282
proud 44283
of 44284
them; 44285
lanky, 44286
scraggy 44287
old-maid 44288
elephants, 44289
with 44290
their 44291
hollow 44292
anxious 44293
faces, 44294
and 44295
trunks 44296
like 44297
rough 44298
bark; 44299
savage 44300
old 44301
bull 44302
elephants, 44303
scarred 44304
from 44305
shoulder 44306
to 44307
flank 44308
with 44309
great 44310
weals 44311
and 44312
cuts 44313
of 44314
bygone 44315
fights, 44316
and 44317
the 44318
caked 44319
dirt 44320
of 44321
their 44322
solitary 44323
mud 44324
baths 44325
dropping 44326
from 44327
their 44328
shoulders; 44329
and 44330
there 44331
was 44332
one 44333
with 44334
a 44335
broken 44336
tusk 44337
and 44338
the 44339
marks 44340
of 44341
the 44342
full-stroke, 44343
the 44344
terrible 44345
drawing 44346
scrape, 44347
of 44348
a 44349
tiger’s 44350
claws 44351
on 44352
his 44353
side. 44354
 44355
They 44356
were 44357
standing 44358
head 44359
to 44360
head, 44361
or 44362
walking 44363
to 44364
and 44365
fro 44366
across 44367
the 44368
ground 44369
in 44370
couples, 44371
or 44372
rocking 44373
and 44374
swaying 44375
all 44376
by 44377
themselves--scores 44378
and 44379
scores 44380
of 44381
elephants. 44382
 44383
Toomai 44384
knew 44385
that 44386
so 44387
long 44388
as 44389
he 44390
lay 44391
still 44392
on 44393
Kala 44394
Nag’s 44395
neck 44396
nothing 44397
would 44398
happen 44399
to 44400
him, 44401
for 44402
even 44403
in 44404
the 44405
rush 44406
and 44407
scramble 44408
of 44409
a 44410
Keddah 44411
drive 44412
a 44413
wild 44414
elephant 44415
does 44416
not 44417
reach 44418
up 44419
with 44420
his 44421
trunk 44422
and 44423
drag 44424
a 44425
man 44426
off 44427
the 44428
neck 44429
of 44430
a 44431
tame 44432
elephant. 44433
And 44434
these 44435
elephants 44436
were 44437
not 44438
thinking 44439
of 44440
men 44441
that 44442
night. 44443
Once 44444
they 44445
started 44446
and 44447
put 44448
their 44449
ears 44450
forward 44451
when 44452
they 44453
heard 44454
the 44455
chinking 44456
of 44457
a 44458
leg 44459
iron 44460
in 44461
the 44462
forest, 44463
but 44464
it 44465
was 44466
Pudmini, 44467
Petersen 44468
Sahib’s 44469
pet 44470
elephant, 44471
her 44472
chain 44473
snapped 44474
short 44475
off, 44476
grunting, 44477
snuffling 44478
up 44479
the 44480
hillside. 44481
She 44482
must 44483
have 44484
broken 44485
her 44486
pickets 44487
and 44488
come 44489
straight 44490
from 44491
Petersen 44492
Sahib’s 44493
camp; 44494
and 44495
Little 44496
Toomai 44497
saw 44498
another 44499
elephant, 44500
one 44501
that 44502
he 44503
did 44504
not 44505
know, 44506
with 44507
deep 44508
rope 44509
galls 44510
on 44511
his 44512
back 44513
and 44514
breast. 44515
He, 44516
too, 44517
must 44518
have 44519
run 44520
away 44521
from 44522
some 44523
camp 44524
in 44525
the 44526
hills 44527
about. 44528
 44529
At 44530
last 44531
there 44532
was 44533
no 44534
sound 44535
of 44536
any 44537
more 44538
elephants 44539
moving 44540
in 44541
the 44542
forest, 44543
and 44544
Kala 44545
Nag 44546
rolled 44547
out 44548
from 44549
his 44550
station 44551
between 44552
the 44553
trees 44554
and 44555
went 44556
into 44557
the 44558
middle 44559
of 44560
the 44561
crowd, 44562
clucking 44563
and 44564
gurgling, 44565
and 44566
all 44567
the 44568
elephants 44569
began 44570
to 44571
talk 44572
in 44573
their 44574
own 44575
tongue, 44576
and 44577
to 44578
move 44579
about. 44580
 44581
Still 44582
lying 44583
down, 44584
Little 44585
Toomai 44586
looked 44587
down 44588
upon 44589
scores 44590
and 44591
scores 44592
of 44593
broad 44594
backs, 44595
and 44596
wagging 44597
ears, 44598
and 44599
tossing 44600
trunks, 44601
and 44602
little 44603
rolling 44604
eyes. 44605
He 44606
heard 44607
the 44608
click 44609
of 44610
tusks 44611
as 44612
they 44613
crossed 44614
other 44615
tusks 44616
by 44617
accident, 44618
and 44619
the 44620
dry 44621
rustle 44622
of 44623
trunks 44624
twined 44625
together, 44626
and 44627
the 44628
chafing 44629
of 44630
enormous 44631
sides 44632
and 44633
shoulders 44634
in 44635
the 44636
crowd, 44637
and 44638
the 44639
incessant 44640
flick 44641
and 44642
hissh 44643
of 44644
the 44645
great 44646
tails. 44647
Then 44648
a 44649
cloud 44650
came 44651
over 44652
the 44653
moon, 44654
and 44655
he 44656
sat 44657
in 44658
black 44659
darkness. 44660
But 44661
the 44662
quiet, 44663
steady 44664
hustling 44665
and 44666
pushing 44667
and 44668
gurgling 44669
went 44670
on 44671
just 44672
the 44673
same. 44674
He 44675
knew 44676
that 44677
there 44678
were 44679
elephants 44680
all 44681
round 44682
Kala 44683
Nag, 44684
and 44685
that 44686
there 44687
was 44688
no 44689
chance 44690
of 44691
backing 44692
him 44693
out 44694
of 44695
the 44696
assembly; 44697
so 44698
he 44699
set 44700
his 44701
teeth 44702
and 44703
shivered. 44704
In 44705
a 44706
Keddah 44707
at 44708
least 44709
there 44710
was 44711
torchlight 44712
and 44713
shouting, 44714
but 44715
here 44716
he 44717
was 44718
all 44719
alone 44720
in 44721
the 44722
dark, 44723
and 44724
once 44725
a 44726
trunk 44727
came 44728
up 44729
and 44730
touched 44731
him 44732
on 44733
the 44734
knee. 44735
 44736
Then 44737
an 44738
elephant 44739
trumpeted, 44740
and 44741
they 44742
all 44743
took 44744
it 44745
up 44746
for 44747
five 44748
or 44749
ten 44750
terrible 44751
seconds. 44752
The 44753
dew 44754
from 44755
the 44756
trees 44757
above 44758
spattered 44759
down 44760
like 44761
rain 44762
on 44763
the 44764
unseen 44765
backs, 44766
and 44767
a 44768
dull 44769
booming 44770
noise 44771
began, 44772
not 44773
very 44774
loud 44775
at 44776
first, 44777
and 44778
Little 44779
Toomai 44780
could 44781
not 44782
tell 44783
what 44784
it 44785
was. 44786
But 44787
it 44788
grew 44789
and 44790
grew, 44791
and 44792
Kala 44793
Nag 44794
lifted 44795
up 44796
one 44797
forefoot 44798
and 44799
then 44800
the 44801
other, 44802
and 44803
brought 44804
them 44805
down 44806
on 44807
the 44808
ground--one-two, 44809
one-two, 44810
as 44811
steadily 44812
as 44813
trip-hammers. 44814
The 44815
elephants 44816
were 44817
stamping 44818
all 44819
together 44820
now, 44821
and 44822
it 44823
sounded 44824
like 44825
a 44826
war 44827
drum 44828
beaten 44829
at 44830
the 44831
mouth 44832
of 44833
a 44834
cave. 44835
The 44836
dew 44837
fell 44838
from 44839
the 44840
trees 44841
till 44842
there 44843
was 44844
no 44845
more 44846
left 44847
to 44848
fall, 44849
and 44850
the 44851
booming 44852
went 44853
on, 44854
and 44855
the 44856
ground 44857
rocked 44858
and 44859
shivered, 44860
and 44861
Little 44862
Toomai 44863
put 44864
his 44865
hands 44866
up 44867
to 44868
his 44869
ears 44870
to 44871
shut 44872
out 44873
the 44874
sound. 44875
But 44876
it 44877
was 44878
all 44879
one 44880
gigantic 44881
jar 44882
that 44883
ran 44884
through 44885
him--this 44886
stamp 44887
of 44888
hundreds 44889
of 44890
heavy 44891
feet 44892
on 44893
the 44894
raw 44895
earth. 44896
Once 44897
or 44898
twice 44899
he 44900
could 44901
feel 44902
Kala 44903
Nag 44904
and 44905
all 44906
the 44907
others 44908
surge 44909
forward 44910
a 44911
few 44912
strides, 44913
and 44914
the 44915
thumping 44916
would 44917
change 44918
to 44919
the 44920
crushing 44921
sound 44922
of 44923
juicy 44924
green 44925
things 44926
being 44927
bruised, 44928
but 44929
in 44930
a 44931
minute 44932
or 44933
two 44934
the 44935
boom 44936
of 44937
feet 44938
on 44939
hard 44940
earth 44941
began 44942
again. 44943
A 44944
tree 44945
was 44946
creaking 44947
and 44948
groaning 44949
somewhere 44950
near 44951
him. 44952
He 44953
put 44954
out 44955
his 44956
arm 44957
and 44958
felt 44959
the 44960
bark, 44961
but 44962
Kala 44963
Nag 44964
moved 44965
forward, 44966
still 44967
tramping, 44968
and 44969
he 44970
could 44971
not 44972
tell 44973
where 44974
he 44975
was 44976
in 44977
the 44978
clearing. 44979
There 44980
was 44981
no 44982
sound 44983
from 44984
the 44985
elephants, 44986
except 44987
once, 44988
when 44989
two 44990
or 44991
three 44992
little 44993
calves 44994
squeaked 44995
together. 44996
Then 44997
he 44998
heard 44999
a 45000
thump 45001
and 45002
a 45003
shuffle, 45004
and 45005
the 45006
booming 45007
went 45008
on. 45009
It 45010
must 45011
have 45012
lasted 45013
fully 45014
two 45015
hours, 45016
and 45017
Little 45018
Toomai 45019
ached 45020
in 45021
every 45022
nerve, 45023
but 45024
he 45025
knew 45026
by 45027
the 45028
smell 45029
of 45030
the 45031
night 45032
air 45033
that 45034
the 45035
dawn 45036
was 45037
coming. 45038
 45039
The 45040
morning 45041
broke 45042
in 45043
one 45044
sheet 45045
of 45046
pale 45047
yellow 45048
behind 45049
the 45050
green 45051
hills, 45052
and 45053
the 45054
booming 45055
stopped 45056
with 45057
the 45058
first 45059
ray, 45060
as 45061
though 45062
the 45063
light 45064
had 45065
been 45066
an 45067
order. 45068
Before 45069
Little 45070
Toomai 45071
had 45072
got 45073
the 45074
ringing 45075
out 45076
of 45077
his 45078
head, 45079
before 45080
even 45081
he 45082
had 45083
shifted 45084
his 45085
position, 45086
there 45087
was 45088
not 45089
an 45090
elephant 45091
in 45092
sight 45093
except 45094
Kala 45095
Nag, 45096
Pudmini, 45097
and 45098
the 45099
elephant 45100
with 45101
the 45102
rope-galls, 45103
and 45104
there 45105
was 45106
neither 45107
sign 45108
nor 45109
rustle 45110
nor 45111
whisper 45112
down 45113
the 45114
hillsides 45115
to 45116
show 45117
where 45118
the 45119
others 45120
had 45121
gone. 45122
 45123
Little 45124
Toomai 45125
stared 45126
again 45127
and 45128
again. 45129
The 45130
clearing, 45131
as 45132
he 45133
remembered 45134
it, 45135
had 45136
grown 45137
in 45138
the 45139
night. 45140
More 45141
trees 45142
stood 45143
in 45144
the 45145
middle 45146
of 45147
it, 45148
but 45149
the 45150
undergrowth 45151
and 45152
the 45153
jungle 45154
grass 45155
at 45156
the 45157
sides 45158
had 45159
been 45160
rolled 45161
back. 45162
Little 45163
Toomai 45164
stared 45165
once 45166
more. 45167
Now 45168
he 45169
understood 45170
the 45171
trampling. 45172
The 45173
elephants 45174
had 45175
stamped 45176
out 45177
more 45178
room--had 45179
stamped 45180
the 45181
thick 45182
grass 45183
and 45184
juicy 45185
cane 45186
to 45187
trash, 45188
the 45189
trash 45190
into 45191
slivers, 45192
the 45193
slivers 45194
into 45195
tiny 45196
fibers, 45197
and 45198
the 45199
fibers 45200
into 45201
hard 45202
earth. 45203
 45204
“Wah!” 45205
said 45206
Little 45207
Toomai, 45208
and 45209
his 45210
eyes 45211
were 45212
very 45213
heavy. 45214
“Kala 45215
Nag, 45216
my 45217
lord, 45218
let 45219
us 45220
keep 45221
by 45222
Pudmini 45223
and 45224
go 45225
to 45226
Petersen 45227
Sahib’s 45228
camp, 45229
or 45230
I 45231
shall 45232
drop 45233
from 45234
thy 45235
neck.” 45236
 45237
The 45238
third 45239
elephant 45240
watched 45241
the 45242
two 45243
go 45244
away, 45245
snorted, 45246
wheeled 45247
round, 45248
and 45249
took 45250
his 45251
own 45252
path. 45253
He 45254
may 45255
have 45256
belonged 45257
to 45258
some 45259
little 45260
native 45261
king’s 45262
establishment, 45263
fifty 45264
or 45265
sixty 45266
or 45267
a 45268
hundred 45269
miles 45270
away. 45271
 45272
Two 45273
hours 45274
later, 45275
as 45276
Petersen 45277
Sahib 45278
was 45279
eating 45280
early 45281
breakfast, 45282
his 45283
elephants, 45284
who 45285
had 45286
been 45287
double 45288
chained 45289
that 45290
night, 45291
began 45292
to 45293
trumpet, 45294
and 45295
Pudmini, 45296
mired 45297
to 45298
the 45299
shoulders, 45300
with 45301
Kala 45302
Nag, 45303
very 45304
footsore, 45305
shambled 45306
into 45307
the 45308
camp. 45309
Little 45310
Toomai’s 45311
face 45312
was 45313
gray 45314
and 45315
pinched, 45316
and 45317
his 45318
hair 45319
was 45320
full 45321
of 45322
leaves 45323
and 45324
drenched 45325
with 45326
dew, 45327
but 45328
he 45329
tried 45330
to 45331
salute 45332
Petersen 45333
Sahib, 45334
and 45335
cried 45336
faintly: 45337
“The 45338
dance--the 45339
elephant 45340
dance! 45341
I 45342
have 45343
seen 45344
it, 45345
and--I 45346
die!” 45347
As 45348
Kala 45349
Nag 45350
sat 45351
down, 45352
he 45353
slid 45354
off 45355
his 45356
neck 45357
in 45358
a 45359
dead 45360
faint. 45361
 45362
But, 45363
since 45364
native 45365
children 45366
have 45367
no 45368
nerves 45369
worth 45370
speaking 45371
of, 45372
in 45373
two 45374
hours 45375
he 45376
was 45377
lying 45378
very 45379
contentedly 45380
in 45381
Petersen 45382
Sahib’s 45383
hammock 45384
with 45385
Petersen 45386
Sahib’s 45387
shooting-coat 45388
under 45389
his 45390
head, 45391
and 45392
a 45393
glass 45394
of 45395
warm 45396
milk, 45397
a 45398
little 45399
brandy, 45400
with 45401
a 45402
dash 45403
of 45404
quinine, 45405
inside 45406
of 45407
him, 45408
and 45409
while 45410
the 45411
old 45412
hairy, 45413
scarred 45414
hunters 45415
of 45416
the 45417
jungles 45418
sat 45419
three 45420
deep 45421
before 45422
him, 45423
looking 45424
at 45425
him 45426
as 45427
though 45428
he 45429
were 45430
a 45431
spirit, 45432
he 45433
told 45434
his 45435
tale 45436
in 45437
short 45438
words, 45439
as 45440
a 45441
child 45442
will, 45443
and 45444
wound 45445
up 45446
with: 45447
 45448
“Now, 45449
if 45450
I 45451
lie 45452
in 45453
one 45454
word, 45455
send 45456
men 45457
to 45458
see, 45459
and 45460
they 45461
will 45462
find 45463
that 45464
the 45465
elephant 45466
folk 45467
have 45468
trampled 45469
down 45470
more 45471
room 45472
in 45473
their 45474
dance-room, 45475
and 45476
they 45477
will 45478
find 45479
ten 45480
and 45481
ten, 45482
and 45483
many 45484
times 45485
ten, 45486
tracks 45487
leading 45488
to 45489
that 45490
dance-room. 45491
They 45492
made 45493
more 45494
room 45495
with 45496
their 45497
feet. 45498
I 45499
have 45500
seen 45501
it. 45502
Kala 45503
Nag 45504
took 45505
me, 45506
and 45507
I 45508
saw. 45509
Also 45510
Kala 45511
Nag 45512
is 45513
very 45514
leg-weary!” 45515
 45516
Little 45517
Toomai 45518
lay 45519
back 45520
and 45521
slept 45522
all 45523
through 45524
the 45525
long 45526
afternoon 45527
and 45528
into 45529
the 45530
twilight, 45531
and 45532
while 45533
he 45534
slept 45535
Petersen 45536
Sahib 45537
and 45538
Machua 45539
Appa 45540
followed 45541
the 45542
track 45543
of 45544
the 45545
two 45546
elephants 45547
for 45548
fifteen 45549
miles 45550
across 45551
the 45552
hills. 45553
Petersen 45554
Sahib 45555
had 45556
spent 45557
eighteen 45558
years 45559
in 45560
catching 45561
elephants, 45562
and 45563
he 45564
had 45565
only 45566
once 45567
before 45568
found 45569
such 45570
a 45571
dance-place. 45572
Machua 45573
Appa 45574
had 45575
no 45576
need 45577
to 45578
look 45579
twice 45580
at 45581
the 45582
clearing 45583
to 45584
see 45585
what 45586
had 45587
been 45588
done 45589
there, 45590
or 45591
to 45592
scratch 45593
with 45594
his 45595
toe 45596
in 45597
the 45598
packed, 45599
rammed 45600
earth. 45601
 45602
“The 45603
child 45604
speaks 45605
truth,” 45606
said 45607
he. 45608
“All 45609
this 45610
was 45611
done 45612
last 45613
night, 45614
and 45615
I 45616
have 45617
counted 45618
seventy 45619
tracks 45620
crossing 45621
the 45622
river. 45623
See, 45624
Sahib, 45625
where 45626
Pudmini’s 45627
leg-iron 45628
cut 45629
the 45630
bark 45631
of 45632
that 45633
tree! 45634
Yes; 45635
she 45636
was 45637
there 45638
too.” 45639
 45640
They 45641
looked 45642
at 45643
one 45644
another 45645
and 45646
up 45647
and 45648
down, 45649
and 45650
they 45651
wondered. 45652
For 45653
the 45654
ways 45655
of 45656
elephants 45657
are 45658
beyond 45659
the 45660
wit 45661
of 45662
any 45663
man, 45664
black 45665
or 45666
white, 45667
to 45668
fathom. 45669
 45670
“Forty 45671
years 45672
and 45673
five,” 45674
said 45675
Machua 45676
Appa, 45677
“have 45678
I 45679
followed 45680
my 45681
lord, 45682
the 45683
elephant, 45684
but 45685
never 45686
have 45687
I 45688
heard 45689
that 45690
any 45691
child 45692
of 45693
man 45694
had 45695
seen 45696
what 45697
this 45698
child 45699
has 45700
seen. 45701
By 45702
all 45703
the 45704
Gods 45705
of 45706
the 45707
Hills, 45708
it 45709
is--what 45710
can 45711
we 45712
say?” 45713
and 45714
he 45715
shook 45716
his 45717
head. 45718
 45719
When 45720
they 45721
got 45722
back 45723
to 45724
camp 45725
it 45726
was 45727
time 45728
for 45729
the 45730
evening 45731
meal. 45732
Petersen 45733
Sahib 45734
ate 45735
alone 45736
in 45737
his 45738
tent, 45739
but 45740
he 45741
gave 45742
orders 45743
that 45744
the 45745
camp 45746
should 45747
have 45748
two 45749
sheep 45750
and 45751
some 45752
fowls, 45753
as 45754
well 45755
as 45756
a 45757
double 45758
ration 45759
of 45760
flour 45761
and 45762
rice 45763
and 45764
salt, 45765
for 45766
he 45767
knew 45768
that 45769
there 45770
would 45771
be 45772
a 45773
feast. 45774
 45775
Big 45776
Toomai 45777
had 45778
come 45779
up 45780
hotfoot 45781
from 45782
the 45783
camp 45784
in 45785
the 45786
plains 45787
to 45788
search 45789
for 45790
his 45791
son 45792
and 45793
his 45794
elephant, 45795
and 45796
now 45797
that 45798
he 45799
had 45800
found 45801
them 45802
he 45803
looked 45804
at 45805
them 45806
as 45807
though 45808
he 45809
were 45810
afraid 45811
of 45812
them 45813
both. 45814
And 45815
there 45816
was 45817
a 45818
feast 45819
by 45820
the 45821
blazing 45822
campfires 45823
in 45824
front 45825
of 45826
the 45827
lines 45828
of 45829
picketed 45830
elephants, 45831
and 45832
Little 45833
Toomai 45834
was 45835
the 45836
hero 45837
of 45838
it 45839
all. 45840
And 45841
the 45842
big 45843
brown 45844
elephant 45845
catchers, 45846
the 45847
trackers 45848
and 45849
drivers 45850
and 45851
ropers, 45852
and 45853
the 45854
men 45855
who 45856
know 45857
all 45858
the 45859
secrets 45860
of 45861
breaking 45862
the 45863
wildest 45864
elephants, 45865
passed 45866
him 45867
from 45868
one 45869
to 45870
the 45871
other, 45872
and 45873
they 45874
marked 45875
his 45876
forehead 45877
with 45878
blood 45879
from 45880
the 45881
breast 45882
of 45883
a 45884
newly 45885
killed 45886
jungle-cock, 45887
to 45888
show 45889
that 45890
he 45891
was 45892
a 45893
forester, 45894
initiated 45895
and 45896
free 45897
of 45898
all 45899
the 45900
jungles. 45901
 45902
And 45903
at 45904
last, 45905
when 45906
the 45907
flames 45908
died 45909
down, 45910
and 45911
the 45912
red 45913
light 45914
of 45915
the 45916
logs 45917
made 45918
the 45919
elephants 45920
look 45921
as 45922
though 45923
they 45924
had 45925
been 45926
dipped 45927
in 45928
blood 45929
too, 45930
Machua 45931
Appa, 45932
the 45933
head 45934
of 45935
all 45936
the 45937
drivers 45938
of 45939
all 45940
the 45941
Keddahs--Machua 45942
Appa, 45943
Petersen 45944
Sahib’s 45945
other 45946
self, 45947
who 45948
had 45949
never 45950
seen 45951
a 45952
made 45953
road 45954
in 45955
forty 45956
years: 45957
Machua 45958
Appa, 45959
who 45960
was 45961
so 45962
great 45963
that 45964
he 45965
had 45966
no 45967
other 45968
name 45969
than 45970
Machua 45971
Appa,--leaped 45972
to 45973
his 45974
feet, 45975
with 45976
Little 45977
Toomai 45978
held 45979
high 45980
in 45981
the 45982
air 45983
above 45984
his 45985
head, 45986
and 45987
shouted: 45988
“Listen, 45989
my 45990
brothers. 45991
Listen, 45992
too, 45993
you 45994
my 45995
lords 45996
in 45997
the 45998
lines 45999
there, 46000
for 46001
I, 46002
Machua 46003
Appa, 46004
am 46005
speaking! 46006
This 46007
little 46008
one 46009
shall 46010
no 46011
more 46012
be 46013
called 46014
Little 46015
Toomai, 46016
but 46017
Toomai 46018
of 46019
the 46020
Elephants, 46021
as 46022
his 46023
great-grandfather 46024
was 46025
called 46026
before 46027
him. 46028
What 46029
never 46030
man 46031
has 46032
seen 46033
he 46034
has 46035
seen 46036
through 46037
the 46038
long 46039
night, 46040
and 46041
the 46042
favor 46043
of 46044
the 46045
elephant-folk 46046
and 46047
of 46048
the 46049
Gods 46050
of 46051
the 46052
Jungles 46053
is 46054
with 46055
him. 46056
He 46057
shall 46058
become 46059
a 46060
great 46061
tracker. 46062
He 46063
shall 46064
become 46065
greater 46066
than 46067
I, 46068
even 46069
I, 46070
Machua 46071
Appa! 46072
He 46073
shall 46074
follow 46075
the 46076
new 46077
trail, 46078
and 46079
the 46080
stale 46081
trail, 46082
and 46083
the 46084
mixed 46085
trail, 46086
with 46087
a 46088
clear 46089
eye! 46090
He 46091
shall 46092
take 46093
no 46094
harm 46095
in 46096
the 46097
Keddah 46098
when 46099
he 46100
runs 46101
under 46102
their 46103
bellies 46104
to 46105
rope 46106
the 46107
wild 46108
tuskers; 46109
and 46110
if 46111
he 46112
slips 46113
before 46114
the 46115
feet 46116
of 46117
the 46118
charging 46119
bull 46120
elephant, 46121
the 46122
bull 46123
elephant 46124
shall 46125
know 46126
who 46127
he 46128
is 46129
and 46130
shall 46131
not 46132
crush 46133
him. 46134
Aihai! 46135
my 46136
lords 46137
in 46138
the 46139
chains,”--he 46140
whirled 46141
up 46142
the 46143
line 46144
of 46145
pickets--“here 46146
is 46147
the 46148
little 46149
one 46150

has 46152
seen 46153
your 46154

your 46157
hidden 46158
places,--the 46159
sight 46160
that 46161
never 46162

ahaa! 46191

hast 46193

him 46195
at 46196
the 46197
dance, 46198

Kala 46202

my 46204
pearl 46205
among 46206
elephants!--ahaa! 46207
Together! 46208
To 46209
Toomai 46210
of 46211
the 46212
Elephants. 46213
Barrao!” 46214
 46215
And 46216
at 46217
that 46218
last 46219
wild 46220
yell 46221
the 46222
whole 46223

flung 46225
up 46226
their 46227
trunks 46228
till 46229
the 46230
tips 46231
touched 46232
their 46233
foreheads, 46234
and 46235
broke 46236
out 46237
into 46238
the 46239
full 46240
salute--the 46241
crashing 46242
trumpet-peal 46243
that 46244
only 46245
the 46246
Viceroy 46247

India 46249
hears, 46250
the 46251
Salaamut 46252
of 46253
the 46254
Keddah. 46255
 46256
But 46257
it 46258
was 46259
all 46260
for 46261
the 46262
sake 46263
of 46264
Little 46265

before--the 46275
dance 46276
of 46277
the 46278
elephants 46279
at 46280
night 46281
and 46282
alone 46283
in 46284
the 46285
heart 46286

 46523
 46524
Parbati 46525

 46533
 46534
 46535
 46536

Little 46621
Things, 46622
O 46623
little 46624

 46628
 46629
 46630
 46631
 46632
 46633
When 46634
the 46635
dole 46636
was 46637
ended, 46638
laughingly 46639
she 46640
said, 46641
 46642
 46643
 46644
 46645
 46646
“Master, 46647
of 46648
a 46649
million 46650
mouths, 46651
is 46652
not 46653
one 46654
unfed?” 46655
 46656
 46657
 46658
 46659
 46660
 46661
Laughing, 46662
Shiv 46663
made 46664
answer, 46665
“All 46666
have 46667
had 46668
their 46669
part, 46670

’neath 46682
thy 46683
heart.” 46684
 46685
 46686
 46687
 46688
 46689
 46690
From 46691
her 46692
breast 46693
she 46694
plucked 46695
it, 46696

the 46698
thief, 46699
 46700
 46701
 46702
 46703
 46704
Saw 46705
the 46706
Least 46707
of 46708
Little 46709
Things 46710
gnawed 46711
a 46712
new-grown 46713
leaf! 46714
 46715
 46716
 46717
 46718
 46719
Saw 46720
and 46721
feared 46722
and 46723
wondered, 46724
making 46725
prayer 46726

Shiv, 46728
 46729
 46730
 46731
 46732
 46733
Who 46734

 46795

mother’s 46797
heart 46798
for 46799
sleepy 46800
head, 46801
O 46802
little 46803

of 46805
mine!_ 46806

 46815
 46816
 46817
 46818
 46819
You 46820
can 46821
work 46822
it 46823
out 46824
by 46825
Fractions 46826

by 46828

of 46831
Three, 46832
 46833
 46834
 46835

 46837
But 46838
the 46839
way 46840
of 46841
Tweedle-dum 46842
is 46843
not 46844
the 46845
way 46846
of 46847
Tweedle-dee. 46848
 46849
 46850
 46851
 46852
 46853
You 46854
can 46855
twist 46856

can 46859
turn 46860
it, 46861

drop, 46868

the 46875
way 46876
of 46877
Pilly 46878
Winky’s 46879
not 46880
the 46881
way 46882
of 46883
Winkie 46884
Pop! 46885
 46886
It 46887
had 46888
been 46889
raining 46890
heavily 46891
for 46892
one 46893
whole 46894
month--raining 46895
on 46896
a 46897
camp 46898
of 46899
thirty 46900
thousand 46901
men 46902
and 46903
thousands 46904
of 46905
camels, 46906
elephants, 46907
horses, 46908
bullocks, 46909
and 46910
mules 46911
all 46912
gathered 46913
together 46914
at 46915
a 46916
place 46917
called 46918
Rawal 46919
Pindi, 46920
to 46921
be 46922
reviewed 46923
by 46924
the 46925
Viceroy 46926
of 46927
India. 46928
He 46929
was 46930
receiving 46931
a 46932
visit 46933
from 46934
the 46935
Amir 46936
of 46937
Afghanistan--a 46938
wild 46939
king 46940
of 46941
a 46942
very 46943
wild 46944
country. 46945
The 46946
Amir 46947
had 46948
brought 46949
with 46950
him 46951
for 46952
a 46953
bodyguard 46954
eight 46955
hundred 46956
men 46957
and 46958
horses 46959
who 46960
had 46961
never 46962
seen 46963
a 46964
camp 46965
or 46966
a 46967
locomotive 46968
before 46969
in 46970
their 46971
lives--savage 46972
men 46973
and 46974
savage 46975
horses 46976
from 46977
somewhere 46978
at 46979
the 46980
back 46981
of 46982
Central 46983
Asia. 46984
Every 46985
night 46986
a 46987
mob 46988
of 46989
these 46990
horses 46991
would 46992
be 46993
sure 46994
to 46995
break 46996
their 46997
heel 46998
ropes 46999
and 47000
stampede 47001
up 47002
and 47003
down 47004
the 47005
camp 47006
through 47007
the 47008
mud 47009
in 47010
the 47011
dark, 47012
or 47013
the 47014
camels 47015
would 47016
break 47017
loose 47018
and 47019
run 47020
about 47021
and 47022
fall 47023
over 47024
the 47025
ropes 47026
of 47027
the 47028
tents, 47029
and 47030
you 47031
can 47032
imagine 47033
how 47034
pleasant 47035
that 47036
was 47037
for 47038
men 47039
trying 47040
to 47041
go 47042
to 47043
sleep. 47044
My 47045
tent 47046
lay 47047
far 47048
away 47049
from 47050
the 47051
camel 47052
lines, 47053
and 47054
I 47055
thought 47056
it 47057
was 47058
safe. 47059
But 47060
one 47061
night 47062
a 47063
man 47064
popped 47065
his 47066
head 47067
in 47068
and 47069
shouted, 47070
“Get 47071
out, 47072
quick! 47073
They’re 47074
coming! 47075
My 47076
tent’s 47077
gone!” 47078
 47079
I 47080
knew 47081
who 47082
“they” 47083
were, 47084
so 47085
I 47086
put 47087
on 47088
my 47089
boots 47090
and 47091
waterproof 47092
and 47093
scuttled 47094
out 47095
into 47096
the 47097
slush. 47098
Little 47099
Vixen, 47100
my 47101
fox 47102
terrier, 47103
went 47104
out 47105
through 47106
the 47107
other 47108
side; 47109
and 47110
then 47111
there 47112
was 47113
a 47114
roaring 47115
and 47116
a 47117
grunting 47118
and 47119
bubbling, 47120
and 47121
I 47122
saw 47123
the 47124
tent 47125
cave 47126
in, 47127
as 47128
the 47129
pole 47130
snapped, 47131
and 47132
begin 47133
to 47134
dance 47135
about 47136
like 47137
a 47138
mad 47139
ghost. 47140
A 47141
camel 47142
had 47143
blundered 47144
into 47145
it, 47146
and 47147
wet 47148
and 47149
angry 47150
as 47151
I 47152
was, 47153
I 47154
could 47155
not 47156
help 47157
laughing. 47158
Then 47159
I 47160
ran 47161
on, 47162
because 47163
I 47164
did 47165
not 47166
know 47167
how 47168
many 47169
camels 47170
might 47171
have 47172
got 47173
loose, 47174
and 47175
before 47176
long 47177
I 47178
was 47179
out 47180
of 47181
sight 47182
of 47183
the 47184
camp, 47185
plowing 47186
my 47187
way 47188
through 47189
the 47190
mud. 47191
 47192
At 47193
last 47194
I 47195
fell 47196
over 47197
the 47198
tail-end 47199
of 47200
a 47201
gun, 47202
and 47203
by 47204
that 47205
knew 47206
I 47207
was 47208
somewhere 47209
near 47210
the 47211
artillery 47212
lines 47213
where 47214
the 47215
cannon 47216
were 47217
stacked 47218
at 47219
night. 47220
As 47221
I 47222
did 47223
not 47224
want 47225
to 47226
plowter 47227
about 47228
any 47229
more 47230
in 47231
the 47232
drizzle 47233
and 47234
the 47235
dark, 47236
I 47237
put 47238
my 47239
waterproof 47240
over 47241
the 47242
muzzle 47243
of 47244
one 47245
gun, 47246
and 47247
made 47248
a 47249
sort 47250
of 47251
wigwam 47252
with 47253
two 47254
or 47255
three 47256
rammers 47257
that 47258
I 47259
found, 47260
and 47261
lay 47262
along 47263
the 47264
tail 47265
of 47266
another 47267
gun, 47268
wondering 47269
where 47270
Vixen 47271
had 47272
got 47273
to, 47274
and 47275
where 47276
I 47277
might 47278
be. 47279
 47280
Just 47281
as 47282
I 47283
was 47284
getting 47285
ready 47286
to 47287
go 47288
to 47289
sleep 47290
I 47291
heard 47292
a 47293
jingle 47294
of 47295
harness 47296
and 47297
a 47298
grunt, 47299
and 47300
a 47301
mule 47302
passed 47303
me 47304
shaking 47305
his 47306
wet 47307
ears. 47308
He 47309
belonged 47310
to 47311
a 47312
screw-gun 47313
battery, 47314
for 47315
I 47316
could 47317
hear 47318
the 47319
rattle 47320
of 47321
the 47322
straps 47323
and 47324
rings 47325
and 47326
chains 47327
and 47328
things 47329
on 47330
his 47331
saddle 47332
pad. 47333
The 47334
screw-guns 47335
are 47336
tiny 47337
little 47338
cannon 47339
made 47340
in 47341
two 47342
pieces, 47343
that 47344
are 47345
screwed 47346
together 47347
when 47348
the 47349
time 47350
comes 47351
to 47352
use 47353
them. 47354
They 47355
are 47356
taken 47357
up 47358
mountains, 47359
anywhere 47360
that 47361
a 47362
mule 47363
can 47364
find 47365
a 47366
road, 47367
and 47368
they 47369
are 47370
very 47371
useful 47372
for 47373
fighting 47374
in 47375
rocky 47376
country. 47377
 47378
Behind 47379
the 47380
mule 47381
there 47382
was 47383
a 47384
camel, 47385
with 47386
his 47387
big 47388
soft 47389
feet 47390
squelching 47391
and 47392
slipping 47393
in 47394
the 47395
mud, 47396
and 47397
his 47398
neck 47399
bobbing 47400
to 47401
and 47402
fro 47403
like 47404
a 47405
strayed 47406
hen’s. 47407
Luckily, 47408
I 47409
knew 47410
enough 47411
of 47412
beast 47413
language--not 47414
wild-beast 47415
language, 47416
but 47417
camp-beast 47418
language, 47419
of 47420
course--from 47421
the 47422
natives 47423
to 47424
know 47425
what 47426
he 47427
was 47428
saying. 47429
 47430
He 47431
must 47432
have 47433
been 47434
the 47435
one 47436
that 47437
flopped 47438
into 47439
my 47440
tent, 47441
for 47442
he 47443
called 47444
to 47445
the 47446
mule, 47447
“What 47448
shall 47449
I 47450
do? 47451
Where 47452
shall 47453
I 47454
go? 47455
I 47456
have 47457
fought 47458
with 47459
a 47460
white 47461
thing 47462
that 47463
waved, 47464
and 47465
it 47466
took 47467
a 47468
stick 47469
and 47470
hit 47471
me 47472
on 47473
the 47474
neck.” 47475
(That 47476
was 47477
my 47478
broken 47479
tent 47480
pole, 47481
and 47482
I 47483
was 47484
very 47485
glad 47486
to 47487
know 47488
it.) 47489
“Shall 47490
we 47491
run 47492
on?” 47493
 47494
“Oh, 47495
it 47496
was 47497
you,” 47498
said 47499
the 47500
mule, 47501
“you 47502
and 47503
your 47504
friends, 47505
that 47506
have 47507
been 47508
disturbing 47509
the 47510
camp? 47511
All 47512
right. 47513
You’ll 47514
be 47515
beaten 47516
for 47517
this 47518
in 47519
the 47520
morning. 47521
But 47522
I 47523
may 47524
as 47525
well 47526
give 47527
you 47528
something 47529
on 47530
account 47531
now.” 47532
 47533
I 47534
heard 47535
the 47536
harness 47537
jingle 47538
as 47539
the 47540
mule 47541
backed 47542
and 47543
caught 47544
the 47545
camel 47546
two 47547
kicks 47548
in 47549
the 47550
ribs 47551
that 47552
rang 47553
like 47554
a 47555
drum. 47556
“Another 47557
time,” 47558
he 47559
said, 47560
“you’ll 47561
know 47562
better 47563
than 47564
to 47565
run 47566
through 47567
a 47568
mule 47569
battery 47570
at 47571
night, 47572
shouting 47573
`Thieves 47574
and 47575
fire!’ 47576
Sit 47577
down, 47578
and 47579
keep 47580
your 47581
silly 47582
neck 47583
quiet.” 47584
 47585
The 47586
camel 47587
doubled 47588
up 47589
camel-fashion, 47590
like 47591
a 47592
two-foot 47593
rule, 47594
and 47595
sat 47596
down 47597
whimpering. 47598
There 47599
was 47600
a 47601
regular 47602
beat 47603
of 47604
hoofs 47605
in 47606
the 47607
darkness, 47608
and 47609
a 47610
big 47611
troop-horse 47612
cantered 47613
up 47614
as 47615
steadily 47616
as 47617
though 47618
he 47619
were 47620
on 47621
parade, 47622
jumped 47623
a 47624
gun 47625
tail, 47626
and 47627
landed 47628
close 47629
to 47630
the 47631
mule. 47632
 47633
“It’s 47634
disgraceful,” 47635
he 47636
said, 47637
blowing 47638
out 47639
his 47640
nostrils. 47641
“Those 47642
camels 47643
have 47644
racketed 47645
through 47646
our 47647
lines 47648
again--the 47649
third 47650
time 47651
this 47652
week. 47653
How’s 47654
a 47655
horse 47656
to 47657
keep 47658
his 47659
condition 47660
if 47661
he 47662
isn’t 47663
allowed 47664
to 47665
sleep. 47666
Who’s 47667
here?” 47668
 47669
“I’m 47670
the 47671
breech-piece 47672
mule 47673
of 47674
number 47675
two 47676
gun 47677
of 47678
the 47679
First 47680
Screw 47681
Battery,” 47682
said 47683
the 47684
mule, 47685
“and 47686
the 47687
other’s 47688
one 47689
of 47690
your 47691
friends. 47692
He’s 47693
waked 47694
me 47695
up 47696
too. 47697
Who 47698
are 47699
you?” 47700
 47701
“Number 47702
Fifteen, 47703
E 47704
troop, 47705
Ninth 47706
Lancers--Dick 47707
Cunliffe’s 47708
horse. 47709
Stand 47710
over 47711
a 47712
little, 47713
there.” 47714
 47715
“Oh, 47716
beg 47717
your 47718
pardon,” 47719
said 47720
the 47721
mule. 47722
“It’s 47723
too 47724
dark 47725
to 47726
see 47727
much. 47728
Aren’t 47729
these 47730
camels 47731
too 47732
sickening 47733
for 47734
anything? 47735
I 47736
walked 47737
out 47738
of 47739
my 47740
lines 47741
to 47742
get 47743
a 47744
little 47745
peace 47746
and 47747
quiet 47748
here.” 47749
 47750
“My 47751
lords,” 47752
said 47753
the 47754
camel 47755
humbly, 47756
“we 47757
dreamed 47758
bad 47759
dreams 47760
in 47761
the 47762
night, 47763
and 47764
we 47765
were 47766
very 47767
much 47768
afraid. 47769
I 47770
am 47771
only 47772
a 47773
baggage 47774
camel 47775
of 47776
the 47777
39th 47778
Native 47779
Infantry, 47780
and 47781
I 47782
am 47783
not 47784
as 47785
brave 47786
as 47787
you 47788
are, 47789
my 47790
lords.” 47791
 47792
“Then 47793
why 47794
didn’t 47795
you 47796
stay 47797
and 47798
carry 47799
baggage 47800
for 47801
the 47802
39th 47803
Native 47804
Infantry, 47805
instead 47806
of 47807
running 47808
all 47809
round 47810
the 47811
camp?” 47812
said 47813
the 47814
mule. 47815
 47816
“They 47817
were 47818
such 47819
very 47820
bad 47821
dreams,” 47822
said 47823
the 47824
camel. 47825
“I 47826
am 47827
sorry. 47828
Listen! 47829
What 47830
is 47831
that? 47832
Shall 47833
we 47834
run 47835
on 47836
again?” 47837
 47838
“Sit 47839
down,” 47840
said 47841
the 47842
mule, 47843
“or 47844
you’ll 47845
snap 47846
your 47847
long 47848
stick-legs 47849
between 47850
the 47851
guns.” 47852
He 47853
cocked 47854
one 47855
ear 47856
and 47857
listened. 47858
“Bullocks!” 47859
he 47860
said. 47861
“Gun 47862
bullocks. 47863
On 47864
my 47865
word, 47866
you 47867
and 47868
your 47869
friends 47870
have 47871
waked 47872
the 47873
camp 47874
very 47875
thoroughly. 47876
It 47877
takes 47878
a 47879
good 47880
deal 47881
of 47882
prodding 47883
to 47884
put 47885
up 47886
a 47887
gun-bullock.” 47888
 47889
I 47890
heard 47891
a 47892
chain 47893
dragging 47894
along 47895
the 47896
ground, 47897
and 47898
a 47899
yoke 47900
of 47901
the 47902
great 47903
sulky 47904
white 47905
bullocks 47906
that 47907
drag 47908
the 47909
heavy 47910
siege 47911
guns 47912
when 47913
the 47914
elephants 47915
won’t 47916
go 47917
any 47918
nearer 47919
to 47920
the 47921
firing, 47922
came 47923
shouldering 47924
along 47925
together. 47926
And 47927
almost 47928
stepping 47929
on 47930
the 47931
chain 47932
was 47933
another 47934
battery 47935
mule, 47936
calling 47937
wildly 47938
for 47939
“Billy.” 47940
 47941
“That’s 47942
one 47943
of 47944
our 47945
recruits,” 47946
said 47947
the 47948
old 47949
mule 47950
to 47951
the 47952
troop 47953
horse. 47954
“He’s 47955
calling 47956
for 47957
me. 47958
Here, 47959
youngster, 47960
stop 47961
squealing. 47962
The 47963
dark 47964
never 47965
hurt 47966
anybody 47967
yet.” 47968
 47969
The 47970
gun-bullocks 47971
lay 47972
down 47973
together 47974
and 47975
began 47976
chewing 47977
the 47978
cud, 47979
but 47980
the 47981
young 47982
mule 47983
huddled 47984
close 47985
to 47986
Billy. 47987
 47988
“Things!” 47989
he 47990
said. 47991
“Fearful 47992
and 47993
horrible, 47994
Billy! 47995
They 47996
came 47997
into 47998
our 47999
lines 48000
while 48001
we 48002
were 48003
asleep. 48004
D’you 48005
think 48006
they’ll 48007
kill 48008
us?” 48009
 48010
“I’ve 48011
a 48012
very 48013
great 48014
mind 48015
to 48016
give 48017
you 48018
a 48019
number-one 48020
kicking,” 48021
said 48022
Billy. 48023
“The 48024
idea 48025
of 48026
a 48027
fourteen-hand 48028
mule 48029
with 48030
your 48031
training 48032
disgracing 48033
the 48034
battery 48035
before 48036
this 48037
gentleman!” 48038
 48039
“Gently, 48040
gently!” 48041
said 48042
the 48043
troop-horse. 48044
“Remember 48045
they 48046
are 48047
always 48048
like 48049
this 48050
to 48051
begin 48052
with. 48053
The 48054
first 48055
time 48056
I 48057
ever 48058
saw 48059
a 48060
man 48061
(it 48062
was 48063
in 48064
Australia 48065
when 48066
I 48067
was 48068
a 48069
three-year-old) 48070
I 48071
ran 48072
for 48073
half 48074
a 48075
day, 48076
and 48077
if 48078
I’d 48079
seen 48080
a 48081
camel, 48082
I 48083
should 48084
have 48085
been 48086
running 48087
still.” 48088
 48089
Nearly 48090
all 48091
our 48092
horses 48093
for 48094
the 48095
English 48096
cavalry 48097
are 48098
brought 48099
to 48100
India 48101
from 48102
Australia, 48103
and 48104
are 48105
broken 48106
in 48107
by 48108
the 48109
troopers 48110
themselves. 48111
 48112
“True 48113
enough,” 48114
said 48115
Billy. 48116
“Stop 48117
shaking, 48118
youngster. 48119
The 48120
first 48121
time 48122
they 48123
put 48124
the 48125
full 48126
harness 48127
with 48128
all 48129
its 48130
chains 48131
on 48132
my 48133
back 48134
I 48135
stood 48136
on 48137
my 48138
forelegs 48139
and 48140
kicked 48141
every 48142
bit 48143
of 48144
it 48145
off. 48146
I 48147
hadn’t 48148
learned 48149
the 48150
real 48151
science 48152
of 48153
kicking 48154
then, 48155
but 48156
the 48157
battery 48158
said 48159
they 48160
had 48161
never 48162
seen 48163
anything 48164
like 48165
it.” 48166
 48167
“But 48168
this 48169
wasn’t 48170
harness 48171
or 48172
anything 48173
that 48174
jingled,” 48175
said 48176
the 48177
young 48178
mule. 48179
“You 48180
know 48181
I 48182
don’t 48183
mind 48184
that 48185
now, 48186
Billy. 48187
It 48188
was 48189
Things 48190
like 48191
trees, 48192
and 48193
they 48194
fell 48195
up 48196
and 48197
down 48198
the 48199
lines 48200
and 48201
bubbled; 48202
and 48203
my 48204
head-rope 48205
broke, 48206
and 48207
I 48208
couldn’t 48209
find 48210
my 48211
driver, 48212
and 48213
I 48214
couldn’t 48215
find 48216
you, 48217
Billy, 48218
so 48219
I 48220
ran 48221
off 48222
with--with 48223
these 48224
gentlemen.” 48225
 48226
“H’m!” 48227
said 48228
Billy. 48229
“As 48230
soon 48231
as 48232
I 48233
heard 48234
the 48235
camels 48236
were 48237
loose 48238
I 48239
came 48240
away 48241
on 48242
my 48243
own 48244
account. 48245
When 48246
a 48247
battery--a 48248
screw-gun 48249
mule 48250
calls 48251
gun-bullocks 48252
gentlemen, 48253
he 48254
must 48255
be 48256
very 48257
badly 48258
shaken 48259
up. 48260
Who 48261
are 48262
you 48263
fellows 48264
on 48265
the 48266
ground 48267
there?” 48268
 48269
The 48270
gun 48271
bullocks 48272
rolled 48273
their 48274
cuds, 48275
and 48276
answered 48277
both 48278
together: 48279
“The 48280
seventh 48281
yoke 48282
of 48283
the 48284
first 48285
gun 48286
of 48287
the 48288
Big 48289
Gun 48290
Battery. 48291
We 48292
were 48293
asleep 48294
when 48295
the 48296
camels 48297
came, 48298
but 48299
when 48300
we 48301
were 48302
trampled 48303
on 48304
we 48305
got 48306
up 48307
and 48308
walked 48309
away. 48310
It 48311
is 48312
better 48313
to 48314
lie 48315
quiet 48316
in 48317
the 48318
mud 48319
than 48320
to 48321
be 48322
disturbed 48323
on 48324
good 48325
bedding. 48326
We 48327
told 48328
your 48329
friend 48330
here 48331
that 48332
there 48333
was 48334
nothing 48335
to 48336
be 48337
afraid 48338
of, 48339
but 48340
he 48341
knew 48342
so 48343
much 48344
that 48345
he 48346
thought 48347
otherwise. 48348
Wah!” 48349
 48350
They 48351
went 48352
on 48353
chewing. 48354
 48355
“That 48356
comes 48357
of 48358
being 48359
afraid,” 48360
said 48361
Billy. 48362
“You 48363
get 48364
laughed 48365
at 48366
by 48367
gun-bullocks. 48368
I 48369
hope 48370
you 48371
like 48372
it, 48373
young 48374
un.” 48375
 48376
The 48377
young 48378
mule’s 48379
teeth 48380
snapped, 48381
and 48382
I 48383
heard 48384
him 48385
say 48386
something 48387
about 48388
not 48389
being 48390
afraid 48391
of 48392
any 48393
beefy 48394
old 48395
bullock 48396
in 48397
the 48398
world. 48399
But 48400
the 48401
bullocks 48402
only 48403
clicked 48404
their 48405
horns 48406
together 48407
and 48408
went 48409
on 48410
chewing. 48411
 48412
“Now, 48413
don’t 48414
be 48415
angry 48416
after 48417
you’ve 48418
been 48419
afraid. 48420
That’s 48421
the 48422
worst 48423
kind 48424
of 48425
cowardice,” 48426
said 48427
the 48428
troop-horse. 48429
“Anybody 48430
can 48431
be 48432
forgiven 48433
for 48434
being 48435
scared 48436
in 48437
the 48438
night, 48439
I 48440
think, 48441
if 48442
they 48443
see 48444
things 48445
they 48446
don’t 48447
understand. 48448
We’ve 48449
broken 48450
out 48451
of 48452
our 48453
pickets, 48454
again 48455
and 48456
again, 48457
four 48458
hundred 48459
and 48460
fifty 48461
of 48462
us, 48463
just 48464
because 48465
a 48466
new 48467
recruit 48468
got 48469
to 48470
telling 48471
tales 48472
of 48473
whip 48474
snakes 48475
at 48476
home 48477
in 48478
Australia 48479
till 48480
we 48481
were 48482
scared 48483
to 48484
death 48485
of 48486
the 48487
loose 48488
ends 48489
of 48490
our 48491
head-ropes.” 48492
 48493
“That’s 48494
all 48495
very 48496
well 48497
in 48498
camp,” 48499
said 48500
Billy. 48501
“I’m 48502
not 48503
above 48504
stampeding 48505
myself, 48506
for 48507
the 48508
fun 48509
of 48510
the 48511
thing, 48512
when 48513
I 48514
haven’t 48515
been 48516
out 48517
for 48518
a 48519
day 48520
or 48521
two. 48522
But 48523
what 48524
do 48525
you 48526
do 48527
on 48528
active 48529
service?” 48530
 48531
“Oh, 48532
that’s 48533
quite 48534
another 48535
set 48536
of 48537
new 48538
shoes,” 48539
said 48540
the 48541
troop 48542
horse. 48543
“Dick 48544
Cunliffe’s 48545
on 48546
my 48547
back 48548
then, 48549
and 48550
drives 48551
his 48552
knees 48553
into 48554
me, 48555
and 48556
all 48557
I 48558
have 48559
to 48560
do 48561
is 48562
to 48563
watch 48564
where 48565
I 48566
am 48567
putting 48568
my 48569
feet, 48570
and 48571
to 48572
keep 48573
my 48574
hind 48575
legs 48576
well 48577
under 48578
me, 48579
and 48580
be 48581
bridle-wise.” 48582
 48583
“What’s 48584
bridle-wise?” 48585
said 48586
the 48587
young 48588
mule. 48589
 48590
“By 48591
the 48592
Blue 48593
Gums 48594
of 48595
the 48596
Back 48597
Blocks,” 48598
snorted 48599
the 48600
troop-horse, 48601
“do 48602
you 48603
mean 48604
to 48605
say 48606
that 48607
you 48608
aren’t 48609
taught 48610
to 48611
be 48612
bridle-wise 48613
in 48614
your 48615
business? 48616
How 48617
can 48618
you 48619
do 48620
anything, 48621
unless 48622
you 48623
can 48624
spin 48625
round 48626
at 48627
once 48628
when 48629
the 48630
rein 48631
is 48632
pressed 48633
on 48634
your 48635
neck? 48636
It 48637
means 48638
life 48639
or 48640
death 48641
to 48642
your 48643
man, 48644
and 48645
of 48646
course 48647
that’s 48648
life 48649
and 48650
death 48651
to 48652
you. 48653
Get 48654
round 48655
with 48656
your 48657
hind 48658
legs 48659
under 48660
you 48661
the 48662
instant 48663
you 48664
feel 48665
the 48666
rein 48667
on 48668
your 48669
neck. 48670
If 48671
you 48672
haven’t 48673
room 48674
to 48675
swing 48676
round, 48677
rear 48678
up 48679
a 48680
little 48681
and 48682
come 48683
round 48684
on 48685
your 48686
hind 48687
legs. 48688
That’s 48689
being 48690
bridle-wise.” 48691
 48692
“We 48693
aren’t 48694
taught 48695
that 48696
way,” 48697
said 48698
Billy 48699
the 48700
mule 48701
stiffly. 48702
“We’re 48703
taught 48704
to 48705
obey 48706
the 48707
man 48708
at 48709
our 48710
head: 48711
step 48712
off 48713
when 48714
he 48715
says 48716
so, 48717
and 48718
step 48719
in 48720
when 48721
he 48722
says 48723
so. 48724
I 48725
suppose 48726
it 48727
comes 48728
to 48729
the 48730
same 48731
thing. 48732
Now, 48733
with 48734
all 48735
this 48736
fine 48737
fancy 48738
business 48739
and 48740
rearing, 48741
which 48742
must 48743
be 48744
very 48745
bad 48746
for 48747
your 48748
hocks, 48749
what 48750
do 48751
you 48752
do?” 48753
 48754
“That 48755
depends,” 48756
said 48757
the 48758
troop-horse. 48759
“Generally 48760
I 48761
have 48762
to 48763
go 48764
in 48765
among 48766
a 48767
lot 48768
of 48769
yelling, 48770
hairy 48771
men 48772
with 48773
knives--long 48774
shiny 48775
knives, 48776
worse 48777
than 48778
the 48779
farrier’s 48780
knives--and 48781
I 48782
have 48783
to 48784
take 48785
care 48786
that 48787
Dick’s 48788
boot 48789
is 48790
just 48791
touching 48792
the 48793
next 48794
man’s 48795
boot 48796
without 48797
crushing 48798
it. 48799
I 48800
can 48801
see 48802
Dick’s 48803
lance 48804
to 48805
the 48806
right 48807
of 48808
my 48809
right 48810
eye, 48811
and 48812
I 48813
know 48814
I’m 48815
safe. 48816
I 48817
shouldn’t 48818
care 48819
to 48820
be 48821
the 48822
man 48823
or 48824
horse 48825
that 48826
stood 48827
up 48828
to 48829
Dick 48830
and 48831
me 48832
when 48833
we’re 48834
in 48835
a 48836
hurry.” 48837
 48838
“Don’t 48839
the 48840
knives 48841
hurt?” 48842
said 48843
the 48844
young 48845
mule. 48846
 48847
“Well, 48848
I 48849
got 48850
one 48851
cut 48852
across 48853
the 48854
chest 48855
once, 48856
but 48857
that 48858
wasn’t 48859
Dick’s 48860
fault--” 48861
 48862
“A 48863
lot 48864
I 48865
should 48866
have 48867
cared 48868
whose 48869
fault 48870
it 48871
was, 48872
if 48873
it 48874
hurt!” 48875
said 48876
the 48877
young 48878
mule. 48879
 48880
“You 48881
must,” 48882
said 48883
the 48884
troop 48885
horse. 48886
“If 48887
you 48888
don’t 48889
trust 48890
your 48891
man, 48892
you 48893
may 48894
as 48895
well 48896
run 48897
away 48898
at 48899
once. 48900
That’s 48901
what 48902
some 48903
of 48904
our 48905
horses 48906
do, 48907
and 48908
I 48909
don’t 48910
blame 48911
them. 48912
As 48913
I 48914
was 48915
saying, 48916
it 48917
wasn’t 48918
Dick’s 48919
fault. 48920
The 48921
man 48922
was 48923
lying 48924
on 48925
the 48926
ground, 48927
and 48928
I 48929
stretched 48930
myself 48931
not 48932
to 48933
tread 48934
on 48935
him, 48936
and 48937
he 48938
slashed 48939
up 48940
at 48941
me. 48942
Next 48943
time 48944
I 48945
have 48946
to 48947
go 48948
over 48949
a 48950
man 48951
lying 48952
down 48953
I 48954
shall 48955
step 48956
on 48957
him--hard.” 48958
 48959
“H’m!” 48960
said 48961
Billy. 48962
“It 48963
sounds 48964
very 48965
foolish. 48966
Knives 48967
are 48968
dirty 48969
things 48970
at 48971
any 48972
time. 48973
The 48974
proper 48975
thing 48976
to 48977
do 48978
is 48979
to 48980
climb 48981
up 48982
a 48983
mountain 48984
with 48985
a 48986
well-balanced 48987
saddle, 48988
hang 48989
on 48990
by 48991
all 48992
four 48993
feet 48994
and 48995
your 48996
ears 48997
too, 48998
and 48999
creep 49000
and 49001
crawl 49002
and 49003
wriggle 49004
along, 49005
till 49006
you 49007
come 49008
out 49009
hundreds 49010
of 49011
feet 49012
above 49013
anyone 49014
else 49015
on 49016
a 49017
ledge 49018
where 49019
there’s 49020
just 49021
room 49022
enough 49023
for 49024
your 49025
hoofs. 49026
Then 49027
you 49028
stand 49029
still 49030
and 49031
keep 49032
quiet--never 49033
ask 49034
a 49035
man 49036
to 49037
hold 49038
your 49039
head, 49040
young 49041
un--keep 49042
quiet 49043
while 49044
the 49045
guns 49046
are 49047
being 49048
put 49049
together, 49050
and 49051
then 49052
you 49053
watch 49054
the 49055
little 49056
poppy 49057
shells 49058
drop 49059
down 49060
into 49061
the 49062
tree-tops 49063
ever 49064
so 49065
far 49066
below.” 49067
 49068
“Don’t 49069
you 49070
ever 49071
trip?” 49072
said 49073
the 49074
troop-horse. 49075
 49076
“They 49077
say 49078
that 49079
when 49080
a 49081
mule 49082
trips 49083
you 49084
can 49085
split 49086
a 49087
hen’s 49088
ear,” 49089
said 49090
Billy. 49091
“Now 49092
and 49093
again 49094
perhaps 49095
a 49096
badly 49097
packed 49098
saddle 49099
will 49100
upset 49101
a 49102
mule, 49103
but 49104
it’s 49105
very 49106
seldom. 49107
I 49108
wish 49109
I 49110
could 49111
show 49112
you 49113
our 49114
business. 49115
It’s 49116
beautiful. 49117
Why, 49118
it 49119
took 49120
me 49121
three 49122
years 49123
to 49124
find 49125
out 49126
what 49127
the 49128
men 49129
were 49130
driving 49131
at. 49132
The 49133
science 49134
of 49135
the 49136
thing 49137
is 49138
never 49139
to 49140
show 49141
up 49142
against 49143
the 49144
sky 49145
line, 49146
because, 49147
if 49148
you 49149
do, 49150
you 49151
may 49152
get 49153
fired 49154
at. 49155
Remember 49156
that, 49157
young 49158
un. 49159
Always 49160
keep 49161
hidden 49162
as 49163
much 49164
as 49165
possible, 49166
even 49167
if 49168
you 49169
have 49170
to 49171
go 49172
a 49173
mile 49174
out 49175
of 49176
your 49177
way. 49178
I 49179
lead 49180
the 49181
battery 49182
when 49183
it 49184
comes 49185
to 49186
that 49187
sort 49188
of 49189
climbing.” 49190
 49191
“Fired 49192
at 49193
without 49194
the 49195
chance 49196
of 49197
running 49198
into 49199
the 49200
people 49201
who 49202
are 49203
firing!” 49204
 49205
said 49206
the 49207
troop-horse, 49208
thinking 49209
hard. 49210
“I 49211
couldn’t 49212
stand 49213
that. 49214
I 49215
should 49216
want 49217
to 49218
charge--with 49219
Dick.” 49220
 49221
“Oh, 49222
no, 49223
you 49224
wouldn’t. 49225
You 49226
know 49227
that 49228
as 49229
soon 49230
as 49231
the 49232
guns 49233
are 49234
in 49235
position 49236
they’ll 49237
do 49238
all 49239
the 49240
charging. 49241
That’s 49242
scientific 49243
and 49244
neat. 49245
But 49246
knives--pah!” 49247
 49248
The 49249
baggage-camel 49250
had 49251
been 49252
bobbing 49253
his 49254
head 49255
to 49256
and 49257
fro 49258
for 49259
some 49260
time 49261
past, 49262
anxious 49263
to 49264
get 49265
a 49266
word 49267
in 49268
edgewise. 49269
Then 49270
I 49271
heard 49272
him 49273
say, 49274
as 49275
he 49276
cleared 49277
his 49278
throat, 49279
nervously: 49280
 49281
“I--I--I 49282
have 49283
fought 49284
a 49285
little, 49286
but 49287
not 49288
in 49289
that 49290
climbing 49291
way 49292
or 49293
that 49294
running 49295
way.” 49296
 49297
“No. 49298
Now 49299
you 49300
mention 49301
it,” 49302
said 49303
Billy, 49304
“you 49305
don’t 49306
look 49307
as 49308
though 49309
you 49310
were 49311
made 49312
for 49313
climbing 49314
or 49315
running--much. 49316
Well, 49317
how 49318
was 49319
it, 49320
old 49321
Hay-bales?” 49322
 49323
“The 49324
proper 49325
way,” 49326
said 49327
the 49328
camel. 49329
“We 49330
all 49331
sat 49332
down--” 49333
 49334
“Oh, 49335
my 49336
crupper 49337
and 49338
breastplate!” 49339
said 49340
the 49341
troop-horse 49342
under 49343
his 49344
breath. 49345
“Sat 49346
down!” 49347
 49348
“We 49349
sat 49350
down--a 49351
hundred 49352
of 49353
us,” 49354
the 49355
camel 49356
went 49357
on, 49358
“in 49359
a 49360
big 49361
square, 49362
and 49363
the 49364
men 49365
piled 49366
our 49367
packs 49368
and 49369
saddles, 49370
outside 49371
the 49372
square, 49373
and 49374
they 49375
fired 49376
over 49377
our 49378
backs, 49379
the 49380
men 49381
did, 49382
on 49383
all 49384
sides 49385
of 49386
the 49387
square.” 49388
 49389
“What 49390
sort 49391
of 49392
men? 49393
Any 49394
men 49395
that 49396
came 49397
along?” 49398
said 49399
the 49400
troop-horse. 49401
“They 49402
teach 49403
us 49404
in 49405
riding 49406
school 49407
to 49408
lie 49409
down 49410
and 49411
let 49412
our 49413
masters 49414
fire 49415
across 49416
us, 49417
but 49418
Dick 49419
Cunliffe 49420
is 49421
the 49422
only 49423
man 49424
I’d 49425
trust 49426
to 49427
do 49428
that. 49429
It 49430
tickles 49431
my 49432
girths, 49433
and, 49434
besides, 49435
I 49436
can’t 49437
see 49438
with 49439
my 49440
head 49441
on 49442
the 49443
ground.” 49444
 49445
“What 49446
does 49447
it 49448
matter 49449
who 49450
fires 49451
across 49452
you?” 49453
said 49454
the 49455
camel. 49456
“There 49457
are 49458
plenty 49459
of 49460
men 49461
and 49462
plenty 49463
of 49464
other 49465
camels 49466
close 49467
by, 49468
and 49469
a 49470
great 49471
many 49472
clouds 49473
of 49474
smoke. 49475
I 49476
am 49477
not 49478
frightened 49479
then. 49480
I 49481
sit 49482
still 49483
and 49484
wait.” 49485
 49486
“And 49487
yet,” 49488
said 49489
Billy, 49490
“you 49491
dream 49492
bad 49493
dreams 49494
and 49495
upset 49496
the 49497
camp 49498
at 49499
night. 49500
Well, 49501
well! 49502
Before 49503
I’d 49504
lie 49505
down, 49506
not 49507
to 49508
speak 49509
of 49510
sitting 49511
down, 49512
and 49513
let 49514
a 49515
man 49516
fire 49517
across 49518
me, 49519
my 49520
heels 49521
and 49522
his 49523
head 49524
would 49525
have 49526
something 49527
to 49528
say 49529
to 49530
each 49531
other. 49532
Did 49533
you 49534
ever 49535
hear 49536
anything 49537
so 49538
awful 49539
as 49540
that?” 49541
 49542
There 49543
was 49544
a 49545
long 49546
silence, 49547
and 49548
then 49549
one 49550
of 49551
the 49552
gun 49553
bullocks 49554
lifted 49555
up 49556
his 49557
big 49558
head 49559
and 49560
said, 49561
“This 49562
is 49563
very 49564
foolish 49565
indeed. 49566
There 49567
is 49568
only 49569
one 49570
way 49571
of 49572
fighting.” 49573
 49574
“Oh, 49575
go 49576
on,” 49577
said 49578
Billy. 49579
“Please 49580
don’t 49581
mind 49582
me. 49583
I 49584
suppose 49585
you 49586
fellows 49587
fight 49588
standing 49589
on 49590
your 49591
tails?” 49592
 49593
“Only 49594
one 49595
way,” 49596
said 49597
the 49598
two 49599
together. 49600
(They 49601
must 49602
have 49603
been 49604
twins.) 49605
“This 49606
is 49607
that 49608
way. 49609
To 49610
put 49611
all 49612
twenty 49613
yoke 49614
of 49615
us 49616
to 49617
the 49618
big 49619
gun 49620
as 49621
soon 49622
as 49623
Two 49624
Tails 49625
trumpets.” 49626
(“Two 49627
Tails” 49628
is 49629
camp 49630
slang 49631
for 49632
the 49633
elephant.) 49634
 49635
“What 49636
does 49637
Two 49638
Tails 49639
trumpet 49640
for?” 49641
said 49642
the 49643
young 49644
mule. 49645
 49646
“To 49647
show 49648
that 49649
he 49650
is 49651
not 49652
going 49653
any 49654
nearer 49655
to 49656
the 49657
smoke 49658
on 49659
the 49660
other 49661
side. 49662
Two 49663
Tails 49664
is 49665
a 49666
great 49667
coward. 49668
Then 49669
we 49670
tug 49671
the 49672
big 49673
gun 49674
all 49675
together--Heya--Hullah! 49676
Heeyah! 49677
Hullah! 49678
We 49679
do 49680
not 49681
climb 49682
like 49683
cats 49684
nor 49685
run 49686
like 49687
calves. 49688
We 49689
go 49690
across 49691
the 49692
level 49693
plain, 49694
twenty 49695
yoke 49696
of 49697
us, 49698
till 49699
we 49700
are 49701
unyoked 49702
again, 49703
and 49704
we 49705
graze 49706
while 49707
the 49708
big 49709
guns 49710
talk 49711
across 49712
the 49713
plain 49714
to 49715
some 49716
town 49717
with 49718
mud 49719
walls, 49720
and 49721
pieces 49722
of 49723
the 49724
wall 49725
fall 49726
out, 49727
and 49728
the 49729
dust 49730
goes 49731
up 49732
as 49733
though 49734
many 49735
cattle 49736
were 49737
coming 49738
home.” 49739
 49740
“Oh! 49741
And 49742
you 49743
choose 49744
that 49745
time 49746
for 49747
grazing?” 49748
said 49749
the 49750
young 49751
mule. 49752
 49753
“That 49754
time 49755
or 49756
any 49757
other. 49758
Eating 49759
is 49760
always 49761
good. 49762
We 49763
eat 49764
till 49765
we 49766
are 49767
yoked 49768
up 49769
again 49770
and 49771
tug 49772
the 49773
gun 49774
back 49775
to 49776
where 49777
Two 49778
Tails 49779
is 49780
waiting 49781
for 49782
it. 49783
Sometimes 49784
there 49785
are 49786
big 49787
guns 49788
in 49789
the 49790
city 49791
that 49792
speak 49793
back, 49794
and 49795
some 49796
of 49797
us 49798
are 49799
killed, 49800
and 49801
then 49802
there 49803
is 49804
all 49805
the 49806
more 49807
grazing 49808
for 49809
those 49810
that 49811
are 49812
left. 49813
This 49814
is 49815
Fate. 49816
None 49817
the 49818
less, 49819
Two 49820
Tails 49821
is 49822
a 49823
great 49824
coward. 49825
That 49826
is 49827
the 49828
proper 49829
way 49830
to 49831
fight. 49832
We 49833
are 49834
brothers 49835
from 49836
Hapur. 49837
Our 49838
father 49839
was 49840
a 49841
sacred 49842
bull 49843
of 49844
Shiva. 49845
We 49846
have 49847
spoken.” 49848
 49849
“Well, 49850
I’ve 49851
certainly 49852
learned 49853
something 49854
tonight,” 49855
said 49856
the 49857
troop-horse. 49858
“Do 49859
you 49860
gentlemen 49861
of 49862
the 49863
screw-gun 49864
battery 49865
feel 49866
inclined 49867
to 49868
eat 49869
when 49870
you 49871
are 49872
being 49873
fired 49874
at 49875
with 49876
big 49877
guns, 49878
and 49879
Two 49880
Tails 49881
is 49882
behind 49883
you?” 49884
 49885
“About 49886
as 49887
much 49888
as 49889
we 49890
feel 49891
inclined 49892
to 49893
sit 49894
down 49895
and 49896
let 49897
men 49898
sprawl 49899
all 49900
over 49901
us, 49902
or 49903
run 49904
into 49905
people 49906
with 49907
knives. 49908
I 49909
never 49910
heard 49911
such 49912
stuff. 49913
A 49914
mountain 49915
ledge, 49916
a 49917
well-balanced 49918
load, 49919
a 49920
driver 49921
you 49922
can 49923
trust 49924
to 49925
let 49926
you 49927
pick 49928
your 49929
own 49930
way, 49931
and 49932
I’m 49933
your 49934
mule. 49935
But--the 49936
other 49937
things--no!” 49938
said 49939
Billy, 49940
with 49941
a 49942
stamp 49943
of 49944
his 49945
foot. 49946
 49947
“Of 49948
course,” 49949
said 49950
the 49951
troop 49952
horse, 49953
“everyone 49954
is 49955
not 49956
made 49957
in 49958
the 49959
same 49960
way, 49961
and 49962
I 49963
can 49964
quite 49965
see 49966
that 49967
your 49968
family, 49969
on 49970
your 49971
father’s 49972
side, 49973
would 49974
fail 49975
to 49976
understand 49977
a 49978
great 49979
many 49980
things.” 49981
 49982
“Never 49983
you 49984
mind 49985
my 49986
family 49987
on 49988
my 49989
father’s 49990
side,” 49991
said 49992
Billy 49993
angrily, 49994
for 49995
every 49996
mule 49997
hates 49998
to 49999
be 50000
reminded 50001
that 50002
his 50003
father 50004
was 50005
a 50006
donkey. 50007
“My 50008
father 50009
was 50010
a 50011
Southern 50012
gentleman, 50013
and 50014
he 50015
could 50016
pull 50017
down 50018
and 50019
bite 50020
and 50021
kick 50022
into 50023
rags 50024
every 50025
horse 50026
he 50027
came 50028
across. 50029
Remember 50030
that, 50031
you 50032
big 50033
brown 50034
Brumby!” 50035
 50036
Brumby 50037
means 50038
wild 50039
horse 50040
without 50041
any 50042
breeding. 50043
Imagine 50044
the 50045
feelings 50046
of 50047
Sunol 50048
if 50049
a 50050
car-horse 50051
called 50052
her 50053
a 50054
“skate,” 50055
and 50056
you 50057
can 50058
imagine 50059
how 50060
the 50061
Australian 50062
horse 50063
felt. 50064
I 50065
saw 50066
the 50067
white 50068
of 50069
his 50070
eye 50071
glitter 50072
in 50073
the 50074
dark. 50075
 50076
“See 50077
here, 50078
you 50079
son 50080
of 50081
an 50082
imported 50083
Malaga 50084
jackass,” 50085
he 50086
said 50087
between 50088
his 50089
teeth, 50090
“I’d 50091
have 50092
you 50093
know 50094
that 50095
I’m 50096
related 50097
on 50098
my 50099
mother’s 50100
side 50101
to 50102
Carbine, 50103
winner 50104
of 50105
the 50106
Melbourne 50107
Cup, 50108
and 50109
where 50110
I 50111
come 50112
from 50113
we 50114
aren’t 50115
accustomed 50116
to 50117
being 50118
ridden 50119
over 50120
roughshod 50121
by 50122
any 50123
parrot-mouthed, 50124
pig-headed 50125
mule 50126
in 50127
a 50128
pop-gun 50129
pea-shooter 50130
battery. 50131
Are 50132
you 50133
ready?” 50134
 50135
“On 50136
your 50137
hind 50138
legs!” 50139
squealed 50140
Billy. 50141
They 50142
both 50143
reared 50144
up 50145
facing 50146
each 50147
other, 50148
and 50149
I 50150
was 50151
expecting 50152
a 50153
furious 50154
fight, 50155
when 50156
a 50157
gurgly, 50158
rumbly 50159
voice, 50160
called 50161
out 50162
of 50163
the 50164
darkness 50165
to 50166
the 50167
right--“Children, 50168
what 50169
are 50170
you 50171
fighting 50172
about 50173
there? 50174
Be 50175
quiet.” 50176
 50177
Both 50178
beasts 50179
dropped 50180
down 50181
with 50182
a 50183
snort 50184
of 50185
disgust, 50186
for 50187
neither 50188
horse 50189
nor 50190
mule 50191
can 50192
bear 50193
to 50194
listen 50195
to 50196
an 50197
elephant’s 50198
voice. 50199
 50200
“It’s 50201
Two 50202
Tails!” 50203
said 50204
the 50205
troop-horse. 50206
“I 50207
can’t 50208
stand 50209
him. 50210
A 50211
tail 50212
at 50213
each 50214
end 50215
isn’t 50216
fair!” 50217
 50218
“My 50219
feelings 50220
exactly,” 50221
said 50222
Billy, 50223
crowding 50224
into 50225
the 50226
troop-horse 50227
for 50228
company. 50229
“We’re 50230
very 50231
alike 50232
in 50233
some 50234
things.” 50235
 50236
“I 50237
suppose 50238
we’ve 50239
inherited 50240
them 50241
from 50242
our 50243
mothers,” 50244
said 50245
the 50246
troop 50247
horse. 50248
“It’s 50249
not 50250
worth 50251
quarreling 50252
about. 50253
Hi! 50254
Two 50255
Tails, 50256
are 50257
you 50258
tied 50259
up?” 50260
 50261
“Yes,” 50262
said 50263
Two 50264
Tails, 50265
with 50266
a 50267
laugh 50268
all 50269
up 50270
his 50271
trunk. 50272
“I’m 50273
picketed 50274
for 50275
the 50276
night. 50277
I’ve 50278
heard 50279
what 50280
you 50281
fellows 50282
have 50283
been 50284
saying. 50285
But 50286
don’t 50287
be 50288
afraid. 50289
I’m 50290
not 50291
coming 50292
over.” 50293
 50294
The 50295
bullocks 50296
and 50297
the 50298
camel 50299
said, 50300
half 50301
aloud, 50302
“Afraid 50303
of 50304
Two 50305
Tails--what 50306
nonsense!” 50307
And 50308
the 50309
bullocks 50310
went 50311
on, 50312
“We 50313
are 50314
sorry 50315
that 50316
you 50317
heard, 50318
but 50319
it 50320
is 50321
true. 50322
Two 50323
Tails, 50324
why 50325
are 50326
you 50327
afraid 50328
of 50329
the 50330
guns 50331
when 50332
they 50333
fire?” 50334
 50335
“Well,” 50336
said 50337
Two 50338
Tails, 50339
rubbing 50340
one 50341
hind 50342
leg 50343
against 50344
the 50345
other, 50346
exactly 50347
like 50348
a 50349
little 50350
boy 50351
saying 50352
a 50353
poem, 50354
“I 50355
don’t 50356
quite 50357
know 50358
whether 50359
you’d 50360
understand.” 50361
 50362
“We 50363
don’t, 50364
but 50365
we 50366
have 50367
to 50368
pull 50369
the 50370
guns,” 50371
said 50372
the 50373
bullocks. 50374
 50375
“I 50376
know 50377
it, 50378
and 50379
I 50380
know 50381
you 50382
are 50383
a 50384
good 50385
deal 50386
braver 50387
than 50388
you 50389
think 50390
you 50391
are. 50392
But 50393
it’s 50394
different 50395
with 50396
me. 50397
My 50398
battery 50399
captain 50400
called 50401
me 50402
a 50403
Pachydermatous 50404
Anachronism 50405
the 50406
other 50407
day.” 50408
 50409
“That’s 50410
another 50411
way 50412
of 50413
fighting, 50414
I 50415
suppose?” 50416
said 50417
Billy, 50418
who 50419
was 50420
recovering 50421
his 50422
spirits. 50423
 50424
“You 50425
don’t 50426
know 50427
what 50428
that 50429
means, 50430
of 50431
course, 50432
but 50433
I 50434
do. 50435
It 50436
means 50437
betwixt 50438
and 50439
between, 50440
and 50441
that 50442
is 50443
just 50444
where 50445
I 50446
am. 50447
I 50448
can 50449
see 50450
inside 50451
my 50452
head 50453
what 50454
will 50455
happen 50456
when 50457
a 50458
shell 50459
bursts, 50460
and 50461
you 50462
bullocks 50463
can’t.” 50464
 50465
“I 50466
can,” 50467
said 50468
the 50469
troop-horse. 50470
“At 50471
least 50472
a 50473
little 50474
bit. 50475
I 50476
try 50477
not 50478
to 50479
think 50480
about 50481
it.” 50482
 50483
“I 50484
can 50485
see 50486
more 50487
than 50488
you, 50489
and 50490
I 50491
do 50492
think 50493
about 50494
it. 50495
I 50496
know 50497
there’s 50498
a 50499
great 50500
deal 50501
of 50502
me 50503
to 50504
take 50505
care 50506
of, 50507
and 50508
I 50509
know 50510
that 50511
nobody 50512
knows 50513
how 50514
to 50515
cure 50516
me 50517
when 50518
I’m 50519
sick. 50520
All 50521
they 50522
can 50523
do 50524
is 50525
to 50526
stop 50527
my 50528
driver’s 50529
pay 50530
till 50531
I 50532
get 50533
well, 50534
and 50535
I 50536
can’t 50537
trust 50538
my 50539
driver.” 50540
 50541
“Ah!” 50542
said 50543
the 50544
troop 50545
horse. 50546
“That 50547
explains 50548
it. 50549
I 50550
can 50551
trust 50552
Dick.” 50553
 50554
“You 50555
could 50556
put 50557
a 50558
whole 50559
regiment 50560
of 50561
Dicks 50562
on 50563
my 50564
back 50565
without 50566
making 50567
me 50568
feel 50569
any 50570
better. 50571
I 50572
know 50573
just 50574
enough 50575
to 50576
be 50577
uncomfortable, 50578
and 50579
not 50580
enough 50581
to 50582
go 50583
on 50584
in 50585
spite 50586
of 50587
it.” 50588
 50589
“We 50590
do 50591
not 50592
understand,” 50593
said 50594
the 50595
bullocks. 50596
 50597
“I 50598
know 50599
you 50600
don’t. 50601
I’m 50602
not 50603
talking 50604
to 50605
you. 50606
You 50607
don’t 50608
know 50609
what 50610
blood 50611
is.” 50612
 50613
“We 50614
do,” 50615
said 50616
the 50617
bullocks. 50618
“It 50619
is 50620
red 50621
stuff 50622
that 50623
soaks 50624
into 50625
the 50626
ground 50627
and 50628
smells.” 50629
 50630
The 50631
troop-horse 50632
gave 50633
a 50634
kick 50635
and 50636
a 50637
bound 50638
and 50639
a 50640
snort. 50641
 50642
“Don’t 50643
talk 50644
of 50645
it,” 50646
he 50647
said. 50648
“I 50649
can 50650
smell 50651
it 50652
now, 50653
just 50654
thinking 50655
of 50656
it. 50657
It 50658
makes 50659
me 50660
want 50661
to 50662
run--when 50663
I 50664
haven’t 50665
Dick 50666
on 50667
my 50668
back.” 50669
 50670
“But 50671
it 50672
is 50673
not 50674
here,” 50675
said 50676
the 50677
camel 50678
and 50679
the 50680
bullocks. 50681
“Why 50682
are 50683
you 50684
so 50685
stupid?” 50686
 50687
“It’s 50688
vile 50689
stuff,” 50690
said 50691
Billy. 50692
“I 50693
don’t 50694
want 50695
to 50696
run, 50697
but 50698
I 50699
don’t 50700
want 50701
to 50702
talk 50703
about 50704
it.” 50705
 50706
“There 50707
you 50708
are!” 50709
said 50710
Two 50711
Tails, 50712
waving 50713
his 50714
tail 50715
to 50716
explain. 50717
 50718
“Surely. 50719
Yes, 50720
we 50721
have 50722
been 50723
here 50724
all 50725
night,” 50726
said 50727
the 50728
bullocks. 50729
 50730
Two 50731
Tails 50732
stamped 50733
his 50734
foot 50735
till 50736
the 50737
iron 50738
ring 50739
on 50740
it 50741
jingled. 50742
“Oh, 50743
I’m 50744
not 50745
talking 50746
to 50747
you. 50748
You 50749
can’t 50750
see 50751
inside 50752
your 50753
heads.” 50754
 50755
“No. 50756
We 50757
see 50758
out 50759
of 50760
our 50761
four 50762
eyes,” 50763
said 50764
the 50765
bullocks. 50766
“We 50767
see 50768
straight 50769
in 50770
front 50771
of 50772
us.” 50773
 50774
“If 50775
I 50776
could 50777
do 50778
that 50779
and 50780
nothing 50781
else, 50782
you 50783
wouldn’t 50784
be 50785
needed 50786
to 50787
pull 50788
the 50789
big 50790
guns 50791
at 50792
all. 50793
If 50794
I 50795
was 50796
like 50797
my 50798
captain--he 50799
can 50800
see 50801
things 50802
inside 50803
his 50804
head 50805
before 50806
the 50807
firing 50808
begins, 50809
and 50810
he 50811
shakes 50812
all 50813
over, 50814
but 50815
he 50816
knows 50817
too 50818
much 50819
to 50820
run 50821
away--if 50822
I 50823
was 50824
like 50825
him 50826
I 50827
could 50828
pull 50829
the 50830
guns. 50831
But 50832
if 50833
I 50834
were 50835
as 50836
wise 50837
as 50838
all 50839
that 50840
I 50841
should 50842
never 50843
be 50844
here. 50845
I 50846
should 50847
be 50848
a 50849
king 50850
in 50851
the 50852
forest, 50853
as 50854
I 50855
used 50856
to 50857
be, 50858
sleeping 50859
half 50860
the 50861
day 50862
and 50863
bathing 50864
when 50865
I 50866
liked. 50867
I 50868
haven’t 50869
had 50870
a 50871
good 50872
bath 50873
for 50874
a 50875
month.” 50876
 50877
“That’s 50878
all 50879
very 50880
fine,” 50881
said 50882
Billy. 50883
“But 50884
giving 50885
a 50886
thing 50887
a 50888
long 50889
name 50890
doesn’t 50891
make 50892
it 50893
any 50894
better.” 50895
 50896
“H’sh!” 50897
said 50898
the 50899
troop 50900
horse. 50901
“I 50902
think 50903
I 50904
understand 50905
what 50906
Two 50907
Tails 50908
means.” 50909
 50910
“You’ll 50911
understand 50912
better 50913
in 50914
a 50915
minute,” 50916
said 50917
Two 50918
Tails 50919
angrily. 50920
“Now 50921
you 50922
just 50923
explain 50924
to 50925
me 50926
why 50927
you 50928
don’t 50929
like 50930
this!” 50931
 50932
He 50933
began 50934
trumpeting 50935
furiously 50936
at 50937
the 50938
top 50939
of 50940
his 50941
trumpet. 50942
 50943
“Stop 50944
that!” 50945
said 50946
Billy 50947
and 50948
the 50949
troop 50950
horse 50951
together, 50952
and 50953
I 50954
could 50955
hear 50956
them 50957
stamp 50958
and 50959
shiver. 50960
An 50961
elephant’s 50962
trumpeting 50963
is 50964
always 50965
nasty, 50966
especially 50967
on 50968
a 50969
dark 50970
night. 50971
 50972
“I 50973
shan’t 50974
stop,” 50975
said 50976
Two 50977
Tails. 50978
“Won’t 50979
you 50980
explain 50981
that, 50982
please? 50983
Hhrrmph! 50984
Rrrt! 50985
Rrrmph! 50986
Rrrhha!” 50987
Then 50988
he 50989
stopped 50990
suddenly, 50991
and 50992
I 50993
heard 50994
a 50995
little 50996
whimper 50997
in 50998
the 50999
dark, 51000
and 51001
knew 51002
that 51003
Vixen 51004
had 51005
found 51006
me 51007
at 51008
last. 51009
She 51010
knew 51011
as 51012
well 51013
as 51014
I 51015
did 51016
that 51017
if 51018
there 51019
is 51020
one 51021
thing 51022
in 51023
the 51024
world 51025
the 51026
elephant 51027
is 51028
more 51029
afraid 51030
of 51031
than 51032
another 51033
it 51034
is 51035
a 51036
little 51037
barking 51038
dog. 51039
So 51040
she 51041
stopped 51042
to 51043
bully 51044
Two 51045
Tails 51046
in 51047
his 51048
pickets, 51049
and 51050
yapped 51051
round 51052
his 51053
big 51054
feet. 51055
Two 51056
Tails 51057
shuffled 51058
and 51059
squeaked. 51060
“Go 51061
away, 51062
little 51063
dog!” 51064
he 51065
said. 51066
“Don’t 51067
snuff 51068
at 51069
my 51070
ankles, 51071
or 51072
I’ll 51073
kick 51074
at 51075
you. 51076
Good 51077
little 51078
dog--nice 51079
little 51080
doggie, 51081
then! 51082
Go 51083
home, 51084
you 51085
yelping 51086
little 51087
beast! 51088
Oh, 51089
why 51090
doesn’t 51091
someone 51092
take 51093
her 51094
away? 51095
She’ll 51096
bite 51097
me 51098
in 51099
a 51100
minute.” 51101
 51102
“Seems 51103
to 51104
me,” 51105
said 51106
Billy 51107
to 51108
the 51109
troop 51110
horse, 51111
“that 51112
our 51113
friend 51114
Two 51115
Tails 51116
is 51117
afraid 51118
of 51119
most 51120
things. 51121
Now, 51122
if 51123
I 51124
had 51125
a 51126
full 51127
meal 51128
for 51129
every 51130
dog 51131
I’ve 51132
kicked 51133
across 51134
the 51135
parade-ground 51136
I 51137
should 51138
be 51139
as 51140
fat 51141
as 51142
Two 51143
Tails 51144
nearly.” 51145
 51146
I 51147
whistled, 51148
and 51149
Vixen 51150
ran 51151
up 51152
to 51153
me, 51154
muddy 51155
all 51156
over, 51157
and 51158
licked 51159
my 51160
nose, 51161
and 51162
told 51163
me 51164
a 51165
long 51166
tale 51167
about 51168
hunting 51169
for 51170
me 51171
all 51172
through 51173
the 51174
camp. 51175
I 51176
never 51177
let 51178
her 51179
know 51180
that 51181
I 51182
understood 51183
beast 51184
talk, 51185
or 51186
she 51187
would 51188
have 51189
taken 51190
all 51191
sorts 51192
of 51193
liberties. 51194
So 51195
I 51196
buttoned 51197
her 51198
into 51199
the 51200
breast 51201
of 51202
my 51203
overcoat, 51204
and 51205
Two 51206
Tails 51207
shuffled 51208
and 51209
stamped 51210
and 51211
growled 51212
to 51213
himself. 51214
 51215
“Extraordinary! 51216
Most 51217
extraordinary!” 51218
he 51219
said. 51220
“It 51221
runs 51222
in 51223
our 51224
family. 51225
Now, 51226
where 51227
has 51228
that 51229
nasty 51230
little 51231
beast 51232
gone 51233
to?” 51234
 51235
I 51236
heard 51237
him 51238
feeling 51239
about 51240
with 51241
his 51242
trunk. 51243
 51244
“We 51245
all 51246
seem 51247
to 51248
be 51249
affected 51250
in 51251
various 51252
ways,” 51253
he 51254
went 51255
on, 51256
blowing 51257
his 51258
nose. 51259
“Now, 51260
you 51261
gentlemen 51262
were 51263
alarmed, 51264
I 51265
believe, 51266
when 51267
I 51268
trumpeted.” 51269
 51270
“Not 51271
alarmed, 51272
exactly,” 51273
said 51274
the 51275
troop-horse, 51276
“but 51277
it 51278
made 51279
me 51280
feel 51281
as 51282
though 51283
I 51284
had 51285
hornets 51286
where 51287
my 51288
saddle 51289
ought 51290
to 51291
be. 51292
Don’t 51293
begin 51294
again.” 51295
 51296
“I’m 51297
frightened 51298
of 51299
a 51300
little 51301
dog, 51302
and 51303
the 51304
camel 51305
here 51306
is 51307
frightened 51308
by 51309
bad 51310
dreams 51311
in 51312
the 51313
night.” 51314
 51315
“It 51316
is 51317
very 51318
lucky 51319
for 51320
us 51321
that 51322
we 51323
haven’t 51324
all 51325
got 51326
to 51327
fight 51328
in 51329
the 51330
same 51331
way,” 51332
said 51333
the 51334
troop-horse. 51335
 51336
“What 51337
I 51338
want 51339
to 51340
know,” 51341
said 51342
the 51343
young 51344
mule, 51345
who 51346
had 51347
been 51348
quiet 51349
for 51350
a 51351
long 51352
time--“what 51353
I 51354
want 51355
to 51356
know 51357
is, 51358
why 51359
we 51360
have 51361
to 51362
fight 51363
at 51364
all.” 51365
 51366
“Because 51367
we’re 51368
told 51369
to,” 51370
said 51371
the 51372
troop-horse, 51373
with 51374
a 51375
snort 51376
of 51377
contempt. 51378
 51379
“Orders,” 51380
said 51381
Billy 51382
the 51383
mule, 51384
and 51385
his 51386
teeth 51387
snapped. 51388
 51389
“Hukm 51390
hai!” 51391
(It 51392
is 51393
an 51394
order!), 51395
said 51396
the 51397
camel 51398
with 51399
a 51400
gurgle, 51401
and 51402
Two 51403
Tails 51404
and 51405
the 51406
bullocks 51407
repeated, 51408
“Hukm 51409
hai!” 51410
 51411
“Yes, 51412
but 51413
who 51414
gives 51415
the 51416
orders?” 51417
said 51418
the 51419
recruit-mule. 51420
 51421
“The 51422
man 51423
who 51424
walks 51425
at 51426
your 51427
head--Or 51428
sits 51429
on 51430
your 51431
back--Or 51432
holds 51433
the 51434
nose 51435
rope--Or 51436
twists 51437
your 51438
tail,” 51439
said 51440
Billy 51441
and 51442
the 51443
troop-horse 51444
and 51445
the 51446
camel 51447
and 51448
the 51449
bullocks 51450
one 51451
after 51452
the 51453
other. 51454
 51455
“But 51456
who 51457
gives 51458
them 51459
the 51460
orders?” 51461
 51462
“Now 51463
you 51464
want 51465
to 51466
know 51467
too 51468
much, 51469
young 51470
un,” 51471
said 51472
Billy, 51473
“and 51474
that 51475
is 51476
one 51477
way 51478
of 51479
getting 51480
kicked. 51481
All 51482
you 51483
have 51484
to 51485
do 51486
is 51487
to 51488
obey 51489
the 51490
man 51491
at 51492
your 51493
head 51494
and 51495
ask 51496
no 51497
questions.” 51498
 51499
“He’s 51500
quite 51501
right,” 51502
said 51503
Two 51504
Tails. 51505
“I 51506
can’t 51507
always 51508
obey, 51509
because 51510
I’m 51511
betwixt 51512
and 51513
between. 51514
But 51515
Billy’s 51516
right. 51517
Obey 51518
the 51519
man 51520
next 51521
to 51522
you 51523
who 51524
gives 51525
the 51526
order, 51527
or 51528
you’ll 51529
stop 51530
all 51531
the 51532
battery, 51533
besides 51534
getting 51535
a 51536
thrashing.” 51537
 51538
The 51539
gun-bullocks 51540
got 51541
up 51542
to 51543
go. 51544
“Morning 51545
is 51546
coming,” 51547
they 51548
said. 51549
“We 51550
will 51551
go 51552
back 51553
to 51554
our 51555
lines. 51556
It 51557
is 51558
true 51559
that 51560
we 51561
only 51562
see 51563
out 51564
of 51565
our 51566
eyes, 51567
and 51568
we 51569
are 51570
not 51571
very 51572
clever. 51573
But 51574
still, 51575
we 51576
are 51577
the 51578
only 51579
people 51580
to-night 51581
who 51582
have 51583
not 51584
been 51585
afraid. 51586
Good-night, 51587
you 51588
brave 51589
people.” 51590
 51591
Nobody 51592
answered, 51593
and 51594
the 51595
troop-horse 51596
said, 51597
to 51598
change 51599
the 51600
conversation, 51601
“Where’s 51602
that 51603
little 51604
dog? 51605
A 51606
dog 51607
means 51608
a 51609
man 51610
somewhere 51611
about.” 51612
 51613
“Here 51614
I 51615
am,” 51616
yapped 51617
Vixen, 51618
“under 51619
the 51620
gun 51621
tail 51622
with 51623
my 51624
man. 51625
You 51626
big, 51627
blundering 51628
beast 51629
of 51630
a 51631
camel 51632
you, 51633
you 51634
upset 51635
our 51636
tent. 51637
My 51638
man’s 51639
very 51640
angry.” 51641
 51642
“Phew!” 51643
said 51644
the 51645
bullocks. 51646
“He 51647
must 51648
be 51649
white!” 51650
 51651
“Of 51652
course 51653
he 51654
is,” 51655
said 51656
Vixen. 51657
“Do 51658
you 51659
suppose 51660
I’m 51661
looked 51662
after 51663
by 51664
a 51665
black 51666
bullock-driver?” 51667
 51668
“Huah! 51669
Ouach! 51670
Ugh!” 51671
said 51672
the 51673
bullocks. 51674
“Let 51675
us 51676
get 51677
away 51678
quickly.” 51679
 51680
They 51681
plunged 51682
forward 51683
in 51684
the 51685
mud, 51686
and 51687
managed 51688
somehow 51689
to 51690
run 51691
their 51692
yoke 51693
on 51694
the 51695
pole 51696
of 51697
an 51698
ammunition 51699
wagon, 51700
where 51701
it 51702
jammed. 51703
 51704
“Now 51705
you 51706
have 51707
done 51708
it,” 51709
said 51710
Billy 51711
calmly. 51712
“Don’t 51713
struggle. 51714
You’re 51715
hung 51716
up 51717
till 51718
daylight. 51719
What 51720
on 51721
earth’s 51722
the 51723
matter?” 51724
 51725
The 51726
bullocks 51727
went 51728
off 51729
into 51730
the 51731
long 51732
hissing 51733
snorts 51734
that 51735
Indian 51736
cattle 51737
give, 51738
and 51739
pushed 51740
and 51741
crowded 51742
and 51743
slued 51744
and 51745
stamped 51746
and 51747
slipped 51748
and 51749
nearly 51750
fell 51751
down 51752
in 51753
the 51754
mud, 51755
grunting 51756
savagely. 51757
 51758
“You’ll 51759
break 51760
your 51761
necks 51762
in 51763
a 51764
minute,” 51765
said 51766
the 51767
troop-horse. 51768
“What’s 51769
the 51770
matter 51771
with 51772
white 51773
men? 51774
I 51775
live 51776
with 51777
’em.” 51778
 51779
“They--eat--us! 51780
Pull!” 51781
said 51782
the 51783
near 51784
bullock. 51785
The 51786
yoke 51787
snapped 51788
with 51789
a 51790
twang, 51791
and 51792
they 51793
lumbered 51794
off 51795
together. 51796
 51797
I 51798
never 51799
knew 51800
before 51801
what 51802
made 51803
Indian 51804
cattle 51805
so 51806
scared 51807
of 51808
Englishmen. 51809
We 51810
eat 51811
beef--a 51812
thing 51813
that 51814
no 51815
cattle-driver 51816
touches--and 51817
of 51818
course 51819
the 51820
cattle 51821
do 51822
not 51823
like 51824
it. 51825
 51826
“May 51827
I 51828
be 51829
flogged 51830
with 51831
my 51832
own 51833
pad-chains! 51834
Who’d 51835
have 51836
thought 51837
of 51838
two 51839
big 51840
lumps 51841
like 51842
those 51843
losing 51844
their 51845
heads?” 51846
said 51847
Billy. 51848
 51849
“Never 51850
mind. 51851
I’m 51852
going 51853
to 51854
look 51855
at 51856
this 51857
man. 51858
Most 51859
of 51860
the 51861
white 51862
men, 51863
I 51864
know, 51865
have 51866
things 51867
in 51868
their 51869
pockets,” 51870
said 51871
the 51872
troop-horse. 51873
 51874
“I’ll 51875
leave 51876
you, 51877
then. 51878
I 51879
can’t 51880
say 51881
I’m 51882
over-fond 51883
of 51884
’em 51885
myself. 51886
Besides, 51887
white 51888
men 51889
who 51890
haven’t 51891
a 51892
place 51893
to 51894
sleep 51895
in 51896
are 51897
more 51898
than 51899
likely 51900
to 51901
be 51902
thieves, 51903
and 51904
I’ve 51905
a 51906
good 51907
deal 51908
of 51909
Government 51910
property 51911
on 51912
my 51913
back. 51914
Come 51915
along, 51916
young 51917
un, 51918
and 51919
we’ll 51920
go 51921
back 51922
to 51923
our 51924
lines. 51925
Good-night, 51926
Australia! 51927
See 51928
you 51929
on 51930
parade 51931
to-morrow, 51932
I 51933
suppose. 51934
Good-night, 51935
old 51936
Hay-bale!--try 51937
to 51938
control 51939
your 51940
feelings, 51941
won’t 51942
you? 51943
Good-night, 51944
Two 51945
Tails! 51946
If 51947
you 51948
pass 51949
us 51950
on 51951
the 51952
ground 51953
tomorrow, 51954
don’t 51955
trumpet. 51956
It 51957
spoils 51958
our 51959
formation.” 51960
 51961
Billy 51962
the 51963
Mule 51964
stumped 51965
off 51966
with 51967
the 51968
swaggering 51969
limp 51970
of 51971
an 51972
old 51973
campaigner, 51974
as 51975
the 51976
troop-horse’s 51977
head 51978
came 51979
nuzzling 51980
into 51981
my 51982
breast, 51983
and 51984
I 51985
gave 51986
him 51987
biscuits, 51988
while 51989
Vixen, 51990
who 51991
is 51992
a 51993
most 51994
conceited 51995
little 51996
dog, 51997
told 51998
him 51999
fibs 52000
about 52001
the 52002
scores 52003
of 52004
horses 52005
that 52006
she 52007
and 52008
I 52009
kept. 52010
 52011
“I’m 52012
coming 52013
to 52014
the 52015
parade 52016
to-morrow 52017
in 52018
my 52019
dog-cart,” 52020
she 52021
said. 52022
“Where 52023
will 52024
you 52025
be?” 52026
 52027
“On 52028
the 52029
left 52030
hand 52031
of 52032
the 52033
second 52034
squadron. 52035
I 52036
set 52037
the 52038
time 52039
for 52040
all 52041
my 52042
troop, 52043
little 52044
lady,” 52045
he 52046
said 52047
politely. 52048
“Now 52049
I 52050
must 52051
go 52052
back 52053
to 52054
Dick. 52055
My 52056
tail’s 52057
all 52058
muddy, 52059
and 52060
he’ll 52061
have 52062
two 52063
hours’ 52064
hard 52065
work 52066
dressing 52067
me 52068
for 52069
parade.” 52070
 52071
The 52072
big 52073
parade 52074
of 52075
all 52076
the 52077
thirty 52078
thousand 52079
men 52080
was 52081
held 52082
that 52083
afternoon, 52084
and 52085
Vixen 52086
and 52087
I 52088
had 52089
a 52090
good 52091
place 52092
close 52093
to 52094
the 52095
Viceroy 52096
and 52097
the 52098
Amir 52099
of 52100
Afghanistan, 52101
with 52102
high, 52103
big 52104
black 52105
hat 52106
of 52107
astrakhan 52108
wool 52109
and 52110
the 52111
great 52112
diamond 52113
star 52114
in 52115
the 52116
center. 52117
The 52118
first 52119
part 52120
of 52121
the 52122
review 52123
was 52124
all 52125
sunshine, 52126
and 52127
the 52128
regiments 52129
went 52130
by 52131
in 52132
wave 52133
upon 52134
wave 52135
of 52136
legs 52137
all 52138
moving 52139
together, 52140
and 52141
guns 52142
all 52143
in 52144
a 52145
line, 52146
till 52147
our 52148
eyes 52149
grew 52150
dizzy. 52151
Then 52152
the 52153
cavalry 52154
came 52155
up, 52156
to 52157
the 52158
beautiful 52159
cavalry 52160
canter 52161
of 52162
“Bonnie 52163
Dundee,” 52164
and 52165
Vixen 52166
cocked 52167
her 52168
ear 52169
where 52170
she 52171
sat 52172
on 52173
the 52174
dog-cart. 52175
The 52176
second 52177
squadron 52178
of 52179
the 52180
Lancers 52181
shot 52182
by, 52183
and 52184
there 52185
was 52186
the 52187
troop-horse, 52188
with 52189
his 52190
tail 52191
like 52192
spun 52193
silk, 52194
his 52195
head 52196
pulled 52197
into 52198
his 52199
breast, 52200
one 52201
ear 52202
forward 52203
and 52204
one 52205
back, 52206
setting 52207
the 52208
time 52209
for 52210
all 52211
his 52212
squadron, 52213
his 52214
legs 52215
going 52216
as 52217
smoothly 52218
as 52219
waltz 52220
music. 52221
Then 52222
the 52223
big 52224
guns 52225
came 52226
by, 52227
and 52228
I 52229
saw 52230
Two 52231
Tails 52232
and 52233
two 52234
other 52235
elephants 52236
harnessed 52237
in 52238
line 52239
to 52240
a 52241
forty-pounder 52242
siege 52243
gun, 52244
while 52245
twenty 52246
yoke 52247
of 52248
oxen 52249
walked 52250
behind. 52251
The 52252
seventh 52253
pair 52254
had 52255
a 52256
new 52257
yoke, 52258
and 52259
they 52260
looked 52261
rather 52262
stiff 52263
and 52264
tired. 52265
Last 52266
came 52267
the 52268
screw 52269
guns, 52270
and 52271
Billy 52272
the 52273
mule 52274
carried 52275
himself 52276
as 52277
though 52278
he 52279
commanded 52280
all 52281
the 52282
troops, 52283
and 52284
his 52285
harness 52286
was 52287
oiled 52288
and 52289
polished 52290
till 52291
it 52292
winked. 52293
I 52294
gave 52295
a 52296
cheer 52297
all 52298
by 52299
myself 52300
for 52301
Billy 52302
the 52303
mule, 52304
but 52305
he 52306
never 52307
looked 52308
right 52309
or 52310
left. 52311
 52312
The 52313
rain 52314
began 52315
to 52316
fall 52317
again, 52318
and 52319
for 52320
a 52321
while 52322
it 52323
was 52324
too 52325
misty 52326
to 52327
see 52328
what 52329
the 52330
troops 52331
were 52332
doing. 52333
They 52334
had 52335
made 52336
a 52337
big 52338
half 52339
circle 52340
across 52341
the 52342
plain, 52343
and 52344
were 52345
spreading 52346
out 52347
into 52348
a 52349
line. 52350
That 52351
line 52352
grew 52353
and 52354
grew 52355
and 52356
grew 52357
till 52358
it 52359
was 52360
three-quarters 52361
of 52362
a 52363
mile 52364
long 52365
from 52366
wing 52367
to 52368
wing--one 52369
solid 52370
wall 52371
of 52372
men, 52373
horses, 52374
and 52375
guns. 52376
Then 52377
it 52378
came 52379
on 52380
straight 52381
toward 52382
the 52383
Viceroy 52384
and 52385
the 52386
Amir, 52387
and 52388
as 52389
it 52390
got 52391
nearer 52392
the 52393
ground 52394
began 52395
to 52396
shake, 52397
like 52398
the 52399
deck 52400
of 52401
a 52402
steamer 52403
when 52404
the 52405
engines 52406
are 52407
going 52408
fast. 52409
 52410
Unless 52411
you 52412
have 52413
been 52414
there 52415
you 52416
cannot 52417
imagine 52418
what 52419
a 52420
frightening 52421
effect 52422
this 52423
steady 52424
come-down 52425
of 52426
troops 52427
has 52428
on 52429
the 52430
spectators, 52431
even 52432
when 52433
they 52434
know 52435
it 52436
is 52437
only 52438
a 52439
review. 52440
I 52441
looked 52442
at 52443
the 52444
Amir. 52445
Up 52446
till 52447
then 52448
he 52449
had 52450
not 52451
shown 52452
the 52453
shadow 52454
of 52455
a 52456
sign 52457
of 52458
astonishment 52459
or 52460
anything 52461
else. 52462
But 52463
now 52464
his 52465
eyes 52466
began 52467
to 52468
get 52469
bigger 52470
and 52471
bigger, 52472
and 52473
he 52474
picked 52475
up 52476
the 52477
reins 52478
on 52479
his 52480
horse’s 52481
neck 52482
and 52483
looked 52484
behind 52485
him. 52486
For 52487
a 52488
minute 52489
it 52490
seemed 52491
as 52492
though 52493
he 52494
were 52495
going 52496
to 52497
draw 52498
his 52499
sword 52500
and 52501
slash 52502
his 52503
way 52504
out 52505
through 52506
the 52507
English 52508
men 52509
and 52510
women 52511
in 52512
the 52513
carriages 52514
at 52515
the 52516
back. 52517
Then 52518
the 52519
advance 52520
stopped 52521
dead, 52522
the 52523
ground 52524
stood 52525
still, 52526
the 52527
whole 52528
line 52529
saluted, 52530
and 52531
thirty 52532
bands 52533
began 52534
to 52535
play 52536
all 52537
together. 52538
That 52539
was 52540
the 52541
end 52542
of 52543
the 52544
review, 52545
and 52546
the 52547

went 52549
off 52550
to 52551
their 52552

in 52554
the 52555
rain, 52556

an 52558

The 52570

Hurrah! 52587
 52588
 52589
 52590
 52591
 52592
The 52593

 52614

they 52617
all 52618

out 52636

the 52638
rain! 52639
 52640
Then 52641
I 52642
heard 52643
an 52644
old 52645
grizzled, 52646
long-haired 52647
Central 52648
Asian 52649
chief, 52650
who 52651
had 52652
come 52653
down 52654
with 52655
the 52656
Amir, 52657
asking 52658
questions 52659
of 52660
a 52661
native 52662
officer. 52663
 52664
“Now,” 52665
said 52666
he, 52667
“in 52668
what 52669
manner 52670
was 52671
this 52672
wonderful 52673
thing 52674
done?” 52675
 52676
And 52677
the 52678
officer 52679
answered, 52680
“An 52681
order 52682
was 52683
given, 52684
and 52685
they 52686
obeyed.” 52687
 52688
“But 52689
are 52690
the 52691
beasts 52692
as 52693
wise 52694
as 52695
the 52696
men?” 52697
said 52698
the 52699
chief. 52700
 52701
“They 52702
obey, 52703
as 52704
the 52705
men 52706
do. 52707
Mule, 52708
horse, 52709
elephant, 52710
or 52711
bullock, 52712
he 52713
obeys 52714
his 52715
driver, 52716
and 52717
the 52718
driver 52719
his 52720
sergeant, 52721
and 52722
the 52723
sergeant 52724

lieutenant, 52726
and 52727
the 52728
lieutenant 52729
his 52730
captain, 52731
and 52732
the 52733
captain 52734
his 52735
major, 52736
and 52737
the 52738
major 52739
his 52740
colonel, 52741
and 52742
the 52743
colonel 52744
his 52745
brigadier 52746
commanding 52747
three 52748
regiments, 52749
and 52750
the 52751
brigadier 52752
the 52753
general, 52754
who 52755
obeys 52756
the 52757
Viceroy, 52758
who 52759
is 52760
the 52761
servant 52762
of 52763
the 52764
Empress. 52765
Thus 52766
it 52767
is 52768
done.” 52769
 52770
“Would 52771
it 52772
were 52773
so 52774
in 52775
Afghanistan!” 52776
said 52777
the 52778
chief, 52779
“for 52780
there 52781
we 52782
obey 52783
only 52784
our 52785
own 52786
wills.” 52787
 52788
“And 52789
for 52790
that 52791
reason,” 52792
said 52793
the 52794
native 52795
officer, 52796
twirling 52797
his 52798
mustache, 52799
“your 52800
Amir 52801

you 52803
